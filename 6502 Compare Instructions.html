<br><a href="http://6502.org/tutorials/tutorials.htm">[Up to Tutorials and Aids]</a> <p></p><hr><p> The
compare instructions set or clear three of the status flags (Carry, Zero,
and Negative) that can be tested with branch instructions, <i> without
altering the contents of the operand</i>.  There are three types of
compare instructions: </p><p><b>The Compare Instructions</b> </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr><td align="center">Instruction</td><td align="center">Description</td>
</tr><tr><td>CMP</td><td><u>C</u>o<u>mp</u>are Memory and Accumulator</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPX</td><td><u>C</u>om<u>p</u>are Memory and Index
<u>X</u></td></tr> <tr><td>CPY</td><td><u>C</u>om<u>p</u>are Memory and
Index <u>Y</u></td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> The CMP instruction
supports eight different addressing modes, the same ones supported by the
ADC and SBC instructions.  Since the X and Y registers function primarily
as counters and indexes, the CPX and CPY instructions do not require this
elaborate addressing capability and operate with just three addressing
modes (immediate, absolute, and zero page). </p><p> The compare instructions
subtract (without carry) an immediate value or the contents of a memory
location from the addressed register, but do not save the result in the
register.  The only indications of the results are the states of the three
status flags: Negative (N), Zero (Z), and Carry (C).  The combination of
these three flags indicate whether the register contents are <i>less than,
equal to</i> (the same as), or <i>greater than</i> the operand "data" (the
immediate value or contents of the addressed memory location.  The table
below summarizes the result indicators for the compare instructions.
</p><p><b>Compare Instruction Results</b>
</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td>Compare Result</td>         <td>N</td><td>Z</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>A, X, or Y &lt; Memory</td> <td>*</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>A, X, or Y = Memory</td>    <td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>A, X, or Y &gt; Memory</td> <td>*</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
</tbody></table> <i>* The N flag will be bit 7 of A, X, or Y - Memory</i>
<p> The compare
instructions serve only one purpose; they provide information that can be
tested by a subsequent branch instruction.  For example, to branch if the
contents of a register are less than an immediate or memory value, you
would follow the compare instruction with a Branch on Carry Clear (BCC)
instruction, as shown by the following:
</p><p><b>Example: Comparing Memory to the Accumulator</b>
</p><table cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr><td><pre>        CMP  $20     ;Accumulator less than location $20?
        BCC  THERE
HERE                 ;No, continue execution here.
        .
        .
        .
THERE                ;Execute this if Accumulator is less than location $20.
        .
        .
        .
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
The table below lists the branch instruction(s) that should follow the
compare instruction, for each register/data relationship.  In this table,
THERE represents the label of the instruction executed if the branch test
succeeds and HERE represents the label of te instruction executed if the
branch test does not succeed.  Besides comparing a memory location and a
register, the compare instructions are handy for comparing one memory location
with another, by loading one into a register (A, X, or Y).
</p><p>

The next example contains a routine that tests whether the contents of two
memory locations are identical, and sets a flag in memory to so indicate.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Example: Testing Two Locations for Equality</b>
</p><table cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td><pre>;This routine sets memory location $22 to "One" if the contents
;of locations $20 and $21 are equal, and to "Zero" if otherwise.

        LDX  #00     ;Initialize flag to zero
        LDA  $20     ;Get first value
        CMP  $21     ;Is second value identical?
        BNE  DONE
        INX          ;Yes, set flag to one
DONE    STX  $22     ;Store flag
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
Below is another memory-to-memory comparison routine.  It stores the larger
of two values in the higher memory location.
</p><p>
<b>Example: Arranging Two Numbers in Order of Value</b>
</p><table cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td><pre>;This routine arranges two numbers in locations $20 and $21 in
;order of value, with the lower-valued number in location $20.

        LDA  $21     ;Load second number into accumulator
        CMP  $20     ;Compare the numbers
        BCS  DONE    ;DONE if first is less than or equal to second.
        LDX  $20
        STA  $20     ;Otherwise swap them.
        STX  $21
DONE     .
         .
         .
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
The next example contains a register-to-constant comparison routine in which
two branch instructions are used with one compare instruction, so that the
"less than", "equal to", and "greater than" conditions are tested.  Since the
branch instructions do not afect any flags in the processor status register,
BNE GT3 is basing its branch decision on the same comparison that the BCS
EQGT3 based its branch decision on!
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Example: A Three-Way Decision Routine</b>
</p><table cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td><pre>;This routine stores the contents of the accumulator into location
;$20, $21, or $22, depending upon whether the accumulator holds a
;value les than 3, equal to 3, or grather than 3, respectively.

        CMP  #03     ;Compare accumulator to 3
        BCS  EQGT3
        STA  $20     ;Accumulator less than 3
        JMP  DONE
EQGT3   BNE  GT3
        STA  $21     ;Accumulator equal to 3
        JMP  DONE
GT3     STA  $22     ;Accumulator greater than 3
DONE     .
         .
         .
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
Thus far, our discussion has concentrated on the CMP instruction, which compares
the accumulator with memory.  Of what value are the other compare instructions
(CPX and CPY)?  Their primary value is to monitor the contents of X or Y when
these registers are being employed as count-up counters.  In these cases,
CPX or CPY is used to compare the count against a maximum value of 255 (decimal)
 in memory.  The next example is a routine that will move up to 256
consecutive memory bytes, with the CPX instruction doing the "all bytes
moved" check each time a byte is moved.
</p><p>
<b>Example: A Multiple-Byte Move Routine</b>
</p><table cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td><pre>;This routine moves up to 256 bytes of memory, starting at
;location $20, to another portion of memory, starting at location
;$0320.  The byte count is contained in location $1F.

        LDX  #00     ;Index = 0
NXTBYT  LDA  $20,X   ;Load next byte
        STA  $0320,X ;Store next byte
        INX          ;Increment index
        CPX  $1F     ;All bytes moved?
        BNE  NXTBYT  ;If not, move next byte
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

The compare instructions compare two "entire" 8-bit values.  There are situations,
however, when you will need to test one or more individual bits in a memory
location.  This can be done by masking out the unwanted bits with an AND
instruction.  However, in the process of masking-out the unwanted bits, the AND
instruction destroys the mask contained in the accumulator.  Certainly, the
mask could be reloaded, but this requires additional processor time and
additional instructions.  The same job can be done, without altering the
accumulator, by executing a BIT instruction.  A tutorial on the BIT instruction can also
be found in the <a href="http://6502.org/tutorials/tutorials.htm">Tutorials</a> section of 6502.org.
