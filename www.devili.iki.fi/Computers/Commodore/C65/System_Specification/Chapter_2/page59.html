<h4><a name="2.3.7.3">2.3.7.3</a> <u>65CE02 Interrupts</u></h4>
    
    <p> There are four basic interrupt sources on the CSG 4502. These are
    RES*, IRQ*, NMI*, and So, for Reset, Interrupt Request, Non-Maskable
    Interrupt, and Set Overflow. The Reset is a hard non-recoverable interrupt
    that stops everything. The IRQ is a "maskable" interrupt, in that its
    occurance can be prevented. The NMI is "non-maskable", and if such an
    event occurs, cannot be prevented. The SO, or Set Overflow, is not really
    an interrupt, but causes an externally generated condition, which can be
    used for control of program flow.
    
    <p> One important design feature, which must be remembered is that no
    interrupt can occur immediately after a one-cycle opcode. This is very
    important, because there are times when you want to temporarily prevent
    interrupts from occurring. The best example of this is, when setting a
    16-bit stack pointer, you do not want an interrupt to occur between the
    times you set the low-order byte, and the high-order byte. If it could
    happen, the interrupt would do stack writes using a pointer that was only
    partially set, thus, writing to an unwanted area.
    
<p>IRQ*
    
    <p> The IRQ* (Interrupt ReQuest) input will cause an interrupt if it is
    at a low logic level, and the I processor status flag is reset. The interrupt
    sequence will begin with the first SYNC after a multiple-cycle opcode. The two
    program counter bytes PCH and PCL, and the processor status register P, are
    pushed onto the stack. (This causes the stack pointer SP to be decremented
    by 3.) Then the program counter bytes PCL and PCH are loaded from memory
    addresses FFFE and FFFF, respectively.
    
    <p> An interrupt caused by the IRQ* input, is similar to the BRK opcode,
    but differs, as follows. The program counter value stored on the stack points
    to the opcode that would have been executed, had the interrupt not occurred.
    On return from interrupt, the processor will return to that opcode. Also, when
    the P register is pushed onto the stack, the B or "break" flag pushed, is zero,
    to indicate that the interrupt was not software generated.
    
<p>NMI*
    
    <p> The NMI* (Non-Maskable Interrupt) input will cause an interrupt after
    receiving, a high to low transition The interrupt sequence will begin with the
    first SYNC after a multiple-cycle opcode. NMI* inputs cannot be masked by
    the processor status register I flag. The two program counter bytes PCH and
    PCL, and the processor status register P, are pushed onto-the stack. (This
    causes the stack pointer SP to be decremented by 3.) Then the program counter
    bytes PCL and PCH are loaded from memory addresses FFFA and FFFB.
    
    <p> As with IRQ*, when the P register is pushed onto the stack, the B or
    "break" flag pushed, is zero, to indicate that the interrupt was not software
    generated.                          A
    
<p>RES*
    
    <p> The RES* (reset) input will cause a hard reset instantly as it is
    brought to a low logic level. This effects the following conditions. The
    currently executing opcode will be terminated. The B and Z registers will
    be cleared. The stack pointer will be set to "byte" mode, with the stack
    page set to page 1. The processor status bits E and I will be set.
    
    <p> The RES* input should be held low for at least 2 clock cycles. But
    once brought high, the reset sequence begins on the CPU cycle. The first
    four cycles of the.reset sequence do nothing. Then the program Counter
    bytes PCL and PCH are loaded from memory addresses FFFC and FFFD, and
    normal program execution begins.

<p>SO
    
    <p> The SO (set overflow) input does, as its name implies, set the
    overflow or V processor status flag. The effect is immediate as this active
    low signal is brought or held at a low logic level. Care should be taken
    if this signal is used, as some of the opcodes can set or reset the
    overflow flag, as well. NOTE: The SO pin has been removed for C65.
