<p>Extended color mode is turned OFF by setting bit 6 of the VIC-II regis-
 ter to a 0 at location 53265 ($D011). The following statement will do
 this:

<h2><a name="Bit">BIT</a> MAPPED GRAPHICS</h2>

<p>When writing games, plotting charts for business applications, or other
 types of programs, sooner or later you get to the point where you want
 high-resolution displays.
  
<p>The Commodore 64 has been designed to do just that: high resolution is
 available through bit mapping of the screen. Bit mapping is the method in
 which each possible dot (pixel) of resolution on the screen is assigned
 its own bit (location) in memory. If that memory bit is a one, the dot it
 is assigned to is on. If the bit is set to zero, the dot is off.

<p>High-resolution graphic design has a couple of drawbacks, which is why
 it is not used all the time. First of all, it takes lots of memory to bit
 map the entire screen. This is because every pixel must have a memory bit
 to control it. You are going to need one bit of memory for each pixel
 (or one byte for 8 pixels). Since each character is 8 by 8, and there are
 40 lines with 25 characters in each line, the resolution is 320 pixels
 (dots) by 200 pixels for the whole screen. That gives you 64000 separate
 dots, each of which requires a bit in memory. In other words, 8000 bytes
 of memory are needed to map the whole screen.

<p>Generally, high-resolution operations are made of many short, 
 simple, repetitive routines. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is 
 usually rather slow if you are trying to write high-resolution 
 routines in BASIC. However, short, simple, repetitive routines are 
 exactly what machine language does best. The solution is to either 
 write your programs entirely in machine language, or call machine 
 language, high-resolution sub- routines from your BASIC program using 
 the SYS command from BASIC. That way you get both the ease of writing 
 in BASIC, and the speed of machine language for graphics. The VSP 
 cartridge is also available to add high-resolution commands to 
 COMMODORE 64 BASIC.

<p> All of the examples given in this section will be in BASIC to make them
 clear. Now to the technical details.

<p> BIT MAPPING is one of the most popular graphics techniques in the
 computer world. It is used to create highly detailed pictures. Basically,
 when the Commodore 64 goes into bit map mode, it directly displays an
