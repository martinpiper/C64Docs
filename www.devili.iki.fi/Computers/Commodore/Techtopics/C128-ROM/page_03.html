<h3>PART NUMBER 318020-05 --EDITOR, KERNEL, CP/M ($C000-$FFFF)</h3>
<ol start="22">
    <li>CAPS LOCK Q.  Previously an error in key matrix decode table caused
        a lowercase 'Q' to be passed when the keyboard is in CAPS LOCK
        mode. The table has been corrected by substituting the correct
        value for upper-case 'Q'.

    <li>FUNCTION KEYs.  Previously the function key handler, part of the
        SCNKEY routine at CKIT2, failed to detect a function key string
        pending. This has been corrected via patch routine, which will
        ignore new function key depressions until the string in prograss
        has been output (i.e., KYNDX = 0). Also, DOPFKEY now exits via
        SCNRTS, instead of simply RTSing.

    <li>IOINIT system initialization.  Previously the RS-232 pseudo-6551
        registers were not initialized because these values are expected to
        be given by the user whenever RS-232 channels are OPENed.
        Apparently many C64 users have taken advantage of the fact the C64
        'happened' to clear these locations an fail to specify critical
        parameters. These RS-232 registers are now initialized to default
        to: no parity, full duplex, 3-line, 1-stop bit, 8-bit words and 300
        baud, via a patch subroutine.

    <li>IOINIT PAL system initialization.  Adjustements have been made to
        the 8563 initialization values fro PAL systems. The PAL horizontal
        total (register 0) changes from $7E to $7F. The PAL vertical total
        (register 4) changes from $27 to $26. These changes sift the cycle
        time from 20.320us to 20.032us. The patch required a patch
        subroutine as well as a change to VDCTBL.

    <li>BASIN system call.  Previosly attempting input from a logical
        channel to the screen (e.g., via INPUT#) resulted line too long
        errors. This has been corrected utilizing a subroutine patch to
        preserve bit-7 of CRSW, which serves as a flag to the Editor that a
        (pseudo) end-of-line has been reached. Also, TBLX is copied to
        LINTMP to correctly locate the current cursor line for the Editor.
        Please note that switching between the 40 and 80-column text
        screens, opening and closing windows, or clearing text screens can
        confuse logical screen channels. The Editor variable LINTMP ($A30)
        is a global, not local, variable as it should have been. Users can
        POKE LINTMP with the logical screen line number before INPUT#'s as
        a work-around.

    <li>OPEN RS-232 system call.  Previously it was possible to receive a
        carry-set status, normally indicating an error, when no error
        existed after OPENing an RS-232 channel. This has been corrected
        totally in-line by a modification to the code which checks for the
        proper X-line hardware states.

    <li>LOAD system call.  Previously the normal (a.k.a. SLOW) load
        mechanism old not preserve the starting address of any LOADs, which
        made the BASIC 'BOOT "file"' command form malfunction
        unpredictably. This is apparent only when used with 1541 drives.
        This has been corrected via a patch subroutine, which saves the
        starting address of all LOADed files at SAL and SAH, the same place
        the fast (a.k.a. BURST) load mechanism does.

    <li>DMA system call.  Previosly the Kernel forced the I/O block into
        the user's memory configuration at all times, which is no longer
        necessary and, in fact, seriously limits the functionality of the
        RAM expansion cartridge. This has been corrected by a ROM patch
        routine, which affects all Kernel DMA system calls as well as the
        BASIC FETCH, STASH, and SWAP commands. Also, previously it was
        possible for an IRQ to occur between the 'arm DMA' and 'trigger
        DMA' sequences, resulting in a DMA orperation with the system
        configuration in context regardless of desired configuration. This
        has been corrected by adding 'PHP/SEI...PLP' instructions around
        the JSR to DMA RAM code at $3F0. Applications using the DMA RAM
        code at $3F0 should do likewise. Finally, in this patch changes
        were made to enable DMA operations to all RAM banks by correctly
        using The VIC bank pointer found in the MMU RAM configuration
        register ($D506, VA16=bit-6 and VA17=bit-7). Applications using the
        Kernel routine at $FF50 will inherit these changes automatically.
        Please note that NMI interrupts can screw-up DMA operations, as
        they cannot be masked.
