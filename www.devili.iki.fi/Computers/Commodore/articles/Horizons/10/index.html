<center><h1>HORIZONS: 64</h1></center>
<p> CHARLES BRANNON
<br>PROGRAM EDITOR

<p> Many people are searching for an alternative to BASIC. BASIC is easy to
    use, easy to learn, and almost carefree in style and coding. Yet BASIC
    is not as fast as a high-level language can be. It does not encourage
    or support modular or even structured programming. It is a very
    general language, so it lacks commands specific to certain situations,
    such as graphics, games, business/professional applications, and
    mathematical work. It's also hard to teach and grade (compared to a
    language like Pascal).

<p> The microcomputer world knows several languages which have come down to
    earth from the mainframe computers: COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, PL/I, LISP,
    APL, even ALGOL. Languages which work out particularly well on micros
    include BASIC, of course, PILOT, Logo, C, and Forth. These languages
    work well within the speed and memory limitations of many personal
    computers.

<p> The business community has been transforming its software choices by
    adapting the larger languages (COBOL, FORTRAN) to 64K Z80 CP/M (Control
    Program for Microprocessors) computers. These languages are often
    subsets of the minicomputer versions of the languages. They are smaller
    versions of the languages, but are still quite powerful and flexible.

<h2>CP/M And The 64</h2>

<p> Many Commodore 64 owners, especially educators and businessmen, are
    intrigued with the Commodore CP/M cartridge. It appears to be a gateway
    to the many thousands of programs that will run only on a CP/M system.

<p> CP/M offers the 8080 or Z80 programmer a set of general, transportable
    microprograms. These microprograms are customized to each computer, yet
    act the same from a program's point of view.

<p> These microprograms make up the Basic Input/Output System, or BIOS. The
    BIOS is much like the 64's set of Kernal routines, which enable a 6510
    machine language programmer to work with input and output. The Kernal's
    strongest point is that its routines have the same addresses (entry
    points) on many Commodore machines. For example, there's a machine
    language program at $FFD2 (hexadecimal) that lets you output a single
    character to the screen or current output device (perhaps the printer
    after a CMD). You can try out this routine from BASIC with POKE
    780,ASC("x"):SYS 65490. x is the character you want to print, so put it
    inside double quotation marks.

<p> All eight-bit CP/M programs are written in either 8080 or Z80 machine
    language. These microprocessors and the commands they use are not
    compatible with the 6510, so you need to add a microprocessor to the
    computer. The Commodore CP/M cartridge contains a Z80 microprocessor
    and plugs into 64's expansion port. It also contains circuitry that
    permits the 64 to switch between the 6510 and the Z80. But you don't
    have CP(M yet. CP/M is supplied on a disk that you load into your 64
    before you begin working with CPM.

<h2>The Disk Problem</h2>

<p> It takes a long time to load. The Commodore 1541 disk drive is not
    fast. To be frank, it is one of the slowest disk drives on the market.
    Don't feel bad, though, it is also about the least expensive. CP/M,
    however, was written tor machines with fast, expensive disk drives.
    It is highly disk-intensive. It accesses the disk frequently for the
    various utilities it performs. The 1541 is the weak link in 64 CP/M.
    Programs behave sluggishly.

<p> But that is not what makes CP/M unusable on the 64. CP/M adds great
    capability and potential, a whole new world. But as you found out when
    you brought your 64 home, it takes software to make your computer do
    anything. And that's what's missing from Commodore CP/M.

<p> Sure, there are probably 10,000 CP/M programs out there, maybe more.
    But there's one big point of incompatibility in the world of CP/M: disk
    formats. Just as you can't even read an Apple or Atari disk on your 64,
    many CP/M computers cannot interchange disks. The BIOS is general, but
    other things like screen formatting and cursor control are not. CP/M
    often requires 80 columns, which isn't easily workable with 64 CP/M.

<p> So COBOL, FORTRAN, and <i>WordStar</i> are available with CP/M, but
    there are no disks you can buy which your 1541 can read. Commodore has
    some plans to release some 1541-readable CP/M software, but we've yet
    to see it.

<p> Dedicated "hackers" or machine language programmers may be interested
    in CP/M. They can write programs which switch between the 6510 and Z80,
    getting a chance to learn about another microprocessor, and enjoying
    the best of both worlds.

<p> Some third-party companies are charging upwards of $300 for CP/M
    (although many do have some CP/M software that can be used with the
    64). Commodore should be applauded for making CP/M available for about
    $60. No other company has sold CP/M, including the necessary hardware,
    for so little. But right now we're waiting for an encore.
