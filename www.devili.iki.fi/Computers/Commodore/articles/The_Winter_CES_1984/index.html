<h1>           Commodore's New Computer Family:<br>
               News From The Winter Consumer Electronics Show</h1>

<p>Selby Bateman, Assistant Editor

<p><strong>
    A new line of Commodore computers with built-in software options the
    264 family created the biggest stir among computer industry retailers
    and distributors at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES).
    Commodore also displayed a growing collection of 64 and VIC-20
    software, a faster disk drive, and a new video monitor. Here's a report
    on the new products and the new choices facing owners and users of
    Commodore computers.
    </strong>

<p> Approximately 90,000 people crowded their way into the Winter Consumer
    Electronics Show, a breathtaking array of almost every conceivable
    electronic audio, video, computer, appliance, and peripheral product
    that manufacturers hope to sell during 1984.

<p> Over one-fourth of the
    725,000 square feet of exhibit space this year was devoted to
    computer-related displays, and nearly 300 of the more than 1300
    exhibitors represented computer products - a record on both counts.

<p> Among the hundreds of exhibition booths at CES, none seemed to attract
    more activity and curiosity than Commodore's large gray and blue
    display on the floor of the Las Vegas Convention Center.

<p> The company announced that during 1983 it became the first
    microcomputer firm to top the $1 billion mark in sales, more than
    doubling its $458 million 1982 sales figures. Commodore officials said
    that all four of its microcomputer models - 64, VIC-20, PET, and CBM -
    achieved record sales levels during 1983.

<p> But the biggest news was the announcement of the new 264 family of
    Commodore computers, which will contain a consumer-selectable choice of
    built-in software; a stronger BASIC language, with 60K available for
    BASIC programming (the Commodore 64 has less than 40K of usable BASIC
    RAM) and more than 75 BASIC commands; a new keyboard that includes a
    HELP key, four separate cursor keys, and other programmable function
    keys; screen windowing capability; and a built-in machine language
    monitor with 12 commands.

<p> A company representative says the 264 should be available by April 1.
    Customers will be able to purchase the 264 with one of several
    application program options built into ROM, such as a word processor,
    spreadsheet, or data base manager. The consumer may have a choice of
    additional software on plug-in ROM chips, but details of the various
    options were still being developed during CES. Although Commodore
    announced no price for the 264, company representatives indicate the
    retail price will be under $500.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> What the new 264 series does <em>not</em> have is almost as interesting
    as what it does. The Commodore 64's versatile SID (Sound Interface
    Device) chip, which features three independent voices over nine
    octaves, had been replaced by two tone generators. That will mean a
    reduction in sound and music capability. And the 64's eight
    programmable, independently moveable sprites have not been included in
    the 264.

<p> Although Commodore says that virtually all of the VIC-20 and 64
    peripherals are compatible with the 264, the software is not.
    Internally the 264 is significantly different than older Commodores
    because of its new operating system and BASIC. Even the cassette buffer
    has been slightly relocated in memory. Also, the central processing
    unit (CPU) is not the 6502/6510 chip found in the VIC and 64; it is a
    new chip called the 7501. Luckily, the 7501 appears to be largely
    compatible with the 6500-series chips, sharing the same instruction
    set.

            left above keyboard). The Commodore 364 will have a similar
            console, but with a 19-key numeric keypad above the cursor keys.

<p> What does all this mean? BASIC programs written for the VIC and 64
    which do not rely heavily on PEEKs, POKEs, sound, or sprite graphics
    probably will work with very little modification on the 264-series
    computers. But machine language programs and BASIC programs which
    manipulate memory with PEEKs and POKEs will need much more
    translating before they'll work on the 264. Almost all commercial
    software falls into the latter category. Commodore estimates that 80 to
    90 percent of VIC and 64 programs should be adaptable to the 264.

<p> Commodore emphasizes that the new family of computers in no way
    indicates a lessening of support by Commodore for the 64, the VIC-20,
    or the company's other microcomputers. As one Commodore,official says,
    the 264 is not directed at the same set of consumers as are the other
    products, especially the top-selling Commodore 64. The 264 offers
    built-in software for word processing, spreadsheet analysis, data base
    management, or other small business applications, notes Myrddin Jones,
    Commodore's vice president for marketing (see interview elsewhere in
    this issue). The 64 is more oriented toward music, sprites, and gaming,
    he adds.

<p> Commodore is counting on the 264 family to complement the 64, VIC-20,
    and the others, rather than to compete with them, Jones says.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> The new Commodore hardware products and options include the following:
<ul>
    <li>Commodore 264 - In addition to the features mentioned above, the
        264 has 128 colors (16 colors with 8 luminance levels); eight
        volume levels; a newly designed 67-key keyboard with four
        reprogrammable function keys; input/output (I/O) ports compatible
        with 64 and VIC-20 peripherals; and display, resolution, and
        character features similar to the 64.
    <li>Commodore 364 -  Based on the 264, the 364 has built in speech
        capabihty with a 250 plus word capacity (additional vocabulary can
        be loaded from optional cartridges or disks); 48K ROM, including
        operating system, BASIC interpreter, and speech operating system
        (up to 48K additional ROM can be added with various built-in
        software options); and an 86-key full-stroke keyboard with a 19-key
        numeric keypad. No suggested price was announced. One Commodore
        representative said the 364 is expected to be available by the end
        of the summer.
    <li>SX64 Portable Computer - Formerly introduced as the SX-100 and
        later the Executive 64, the SX64 is a portable 64 rather than a
        264-based machine. The SX64 has a built-in 5-inch color monitor, a
        170K built-in 5%-inch floppy disk drive (second drive optional),
        plus other features identical to the Commodore 64. The retail price
        is $995.
    <li>1703 Color Monitor - Housed in a charcoal gray box, the new
        Commodore monitor is similar in other ways to the earlier 1702 and
        1701. The 1703 has a 13-inch diagonal screen and is compatible
        with the 264 line as well as with the 64, VIC-20, and SX64.
    <li>SFS 481 Fast Disk Drive - The new 5%-inch Commodore disk drive, for
        use with the 264 and 364 only, is reportedly five times faster than
        the 1541 drive.
    <li>1542 Disk Drive - An upgraded version of the 1541. Further details
        will be announced by Commodore.
    <li>Commodore TouchScreen - A plastic overlay that can be fitted over
        the front of a television set or a video monitor, the new
        TouchScreen allows the user to bypass the keyboard completely in
        order to operate such programs as Commodore's Magic Desk or to
        create graphics with the touch of a finger. No word yet on
        availability or price.
    <li>Commodore Light Pen - A pressure-sensitive mechanism near the point
        of this light pen allows you to draw and to move objects on the
        screen and to control programs such as Magic Desk.
    <li>Magic Voice Speech Module - The speech module plugs into the User
        Port of the Commodore 64, and contains an additional port into
        which other cartridges can be inserted. The module has a built-in
        vocabulary of 235 words, spoken by what sounds like a female voice.
        Words can be user-defined for various speeds and programmed
        directly from BASIC and/or machine language. Commodore promises
        that more words and different voices will be available in the
        future on disk and cartridge. The speech module has a suggested
        price of $59.95 and can be plugged into the SX64 portable computer
        as well.
</ul>

<p> The introduction of the 264 line meant that Commodore was one of the
    few computer companies to introduce a new machine at the four-day CES
    show, a far cry from last summer's CES in Chicago. Seventeen new
    microcomputers were introduced at that time.

<p> Atari, Inc. introduced no new computers at the winter CES. Apple showed
    up for the first time in three years, but chose not to unveil its
    MacIntosh at the show. IBM had no exhibit at all. Coleco introduced
    some new peripherals for its Adam computer, including an add-on tape
    drive, a disk drive, 1200-baud modem, and a 64K memory expander.
    Spectravideo announced two new computers, and a British company
    exhibited prototypes of a new machine which might reach the U.S.
    later this year. But none of these booths were as consistently crowded
    as Commodore's.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Commodore is continuing to expand its software line and announced a
    variety of personal productivity and game offerings. For the Commodore
    264, Sig Hartmann, president of Commodore Software, says that the
    company plans to have more than 30 software products available on
    cartridge, disk, and tape when the 264 goes on sale. "The key area
    we're emphasizing in software for the Commodore 264 is productivity
    covering such areas as household management, word processing,
    calculation, business accounting, and education," says Hartmann.

<p> Commodore is continuing to encourage third-party software development
    for its computers, and introduced a number of new packages which were
    created for it by such companies as Data 20, Digital Research, Infocom,
    Island Graphics, and others. For example, Data 20 Corporation of Laguna
    Hills, California, created word processing, spreadsheet, and graph
    software on ROM chips for the new 264 computer line, some of which will
    be built-in and some will be cartridge add-ons.

<p> Of the more than 200 Commodore-brand software products now in
    distribution, more than half were produced by outside developers, a
    company official notes. Among the new products are seven personal
    productivity packages, which are scheduled to be available by late
    spring on cartridge or disk for the Commodore 64 and 264. Several of
    the programs are planned as built-in software options for the 264 as
    well. The packages are:
<ul>
    <li><em>Magic Desk II</em> - Based on the <em>Magic Desk I</em> - Type
        and File cartridge introduced last year, this is an enhanced
        program with an integrated text-editor, spreadsheet, file manager,
        and calculator for beginning computer users. Help screens are
        built-in, and the menu system uses icons, or picture-symbols,
        rather than words to convey the different functions (similar to
        Apple's more complex business-oriented Lisa).

        </table></td></tr></table></center>

    <li><em>Commodore 3-Plus-1</em> - This integrated software package
        includes a word processor, file manager, spreadsheet, and business
        graphics. Through windowing, the word processor and the spreadsheet
        may be used simultaneously on the screen.
    <li><em>SuperScript 264</em> - A multifunction word processor designed
        for both beginner and expert users, the package includes text
        editing, number calculations, mail-list functions, and a
        cut-and-paste feature for on-screen text editing.
    <li><em>EasyCalc 64</em> and <em>EasyCalc 264</em> - These are
        spreadsheet programs with color selection and graphics. Both
        packages are sold on cartridge, which Commodore says leaves more
        workspace in the computer than comparable disk-based spreadsheets.
    <li><em>Commodore B/Graph</em> - A business graphics and statistics
        package, B/Graph computes and converts financial and statistical
        results into three-dimensional color charts, graphs, pie charts,
        histograms, and other graphics.
    <li><em>Financial Advisor</em> - A financial aid program, <em>Financial
        Advisor</em> computes loan, mortgage, and investment formulas, and
        is available on cartridge.
    <li><em>Teligraphics</em> - This is videotext and graphics software for
        use with Commodore telecommunications modems. It allows
        transmission of pictures, text, and business graphics over the
        telephone and between computers. The package also allows users to
        upload and download data through telecomputing services such as
        CompuServe.
</ul>

<p> Commodore announced its intention to provide 100 different application
    templates for its Manager 64 data base system used by the Commodore 64.
    The templates will include five to ten specific applications per disk
    which, when used with Manager 64, will allow the user to computerize
    home budgets, index recipes, keep track of sports statistics, track
    business accounts, and carry out other functions.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Among the other software packages announced at CES by Commodore are:
<ul>
    <li>Ten new educational software products, including the <em>Milliken
        Edufun</em> (VIC-20 and Commodore 64) series, the <em>Kinder
        Koncepts</em> (Commodore 64) series, and two new programs featuring
        the animated "Commodore Kids," <em>Math Facts</em> and <em>Numbers
        Galore</em>.
    <li><em>Commodore Logo</em> programming language for the 64 and 264
        computers, with 170K of available disk storage.
    <li><em>International Soccer,</em> the first in a series of advanced
        games with three-dimensional color animation which Commodore is
        calling the Gold Medallion games. Suggested retail price is $34.95,
        and the game should be available by the time you read this.
    <li>Other entertainment programs introduced include <em>Viduzzles,</em>
        a series of video puzzles for children; <em>Jack Attack,</em> an
        animated strategy game; and <em>Solar Fox,</em> a converted Bally
        Midway adventure game. Initial deliveries are scheduled for this
        spring.
    <li>Four new "talking" software products for use with Commodore's new
        Magic Voice speech module in the 64 and 264 computers. Two of the
        programs are Bally Midway games - <em>Gorf</em> and <em>Wizard of
        Wor</em> - and two are alphabet and number educational packages for
        young children - <em>A Bee C's</em> and <em>Counting Bee.</em>
        Prices for the games should be in the $30-$40 range, Commodore
        announced.
    <li><em>Micro Illustrator</em> for the Commodore 64 and 264 computers,
        a popular "paint" system for creation of color graphics. The
        package uses a menu of icons and either a joystick or light pen.
        The Commodore 64 version will use all 16 of its colors and was
        scheduled for February release, while the 264 version will have a
        range of 128 colors and is set for an April release.
    <li><em>Micro Cookbook</em> for the Commodore 64, a household
        management program providing cook-book and recipe management.
        Features include meal planning (plus help with leftovers), a
        glossary of cooking terms, calorie and nutritional information, and
        155 recipes with space for 100 more. Initial sales were scheduled
        for early February at under $40 each.
    <li><em>Silent Butler</em> and financial management package on disk,
        which is designed to require little or no instructions, setup
        process, or previous computer experience. The program will manage
        personal finances and records, balance checkbooks, pay bills,
        provide a tax summary, and serve as an appointment or special date
        reminder. The Silent Butler comes with a plastic form with
        pockets in which the user can place personal checks for printing on
        a 1525, 1526, or MPS-801 printer.
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Independent companies continue to develop and market a growing number
    of hardware and software products for the Commodore microcomputers.

<p> Chalk Board, Inc., developer of the PowerPad touch tablet, announced
    six new software packages scheduled for release in the first quarter of
    1984. They include <em>Leo's 'Lectric Graphics,</em> a graphics system
    which allows users to do finger painting, multiple-contact drawing, or
    a fine, point-to-point drawing; <em>Leonardo's Logo,</em> a turtle
    graphics program which employs push-button symbolic graphics in place
    of keyboard entry; <em>Leonardo's Philharmonic,</em> a music
    composition package; <em>Boolean Blueprints,</em> an advanced BASIC
    tutor for the novice; <em>Runway,</em> an aircraft navigation and
    piloting simulation program based on geometric principles; and
    <em>Borderline,</em> an international relations simulation game.

<p> AtariSoft, the third-party software publishing division of Atari,
    announced conversions of seven hit arcade titles for the Commodore 64
    and VIC-20. The games are <em>Joust, Battlezone, Pole Position, Ms.
    Pac-Man, Moon Patrol, Galaxian,</em> and <em>Jungle Hunt.</em>
    Suggested prices for each game are $34.95 on disk and $44.95 on
    cartridge.

<p> Waveform Corp. introduced MusiCalc I, a software package designed to
    transform the Commodore 64 into a three-voice synthesizer with realtime
    sequencing, slide controls, modulators, and transposers. The program
    allows users to play along with preprogrammed melodies, or create and
    store their own melodies for later playback. The suggested price is
    $74.95.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Br&oslash;derbund Software has converted its popular word processing
    program, <em>Bank Street Writer,</em> to disk format for the Commodore
    64. Previously available for Apple and Atari computers, <em>Bank Street
    Writer</em> displays all functions and commands at the top of the
    screen in order to eliminate the need for memorizing codes or command
    words. Suggested retail price is $69.95.

<p> Human Engineered Software (HesWare), the largest single-source supplier
    of software for the Commodore 64, announced seven new educational and
    productivity programs for the 64. <em>Turtls Toyland Jr.,</em> produced
    for HesWare by ChildWare Corporation of Menlo Park, California,
    operates with a joystick and teaches turtle graphics and programming
    concepts to children. HesWare also announced three new educational
    titles from Sunburst Software - <em>Factory,</em> for those eight years or
    older, places the user in the role of a design engineer who must
    create geometric products on an assembly line; <em>M-ss-ng L-nks,</em>
    ages ten and above, is a language puzzle designed to improve spelling,
    grammar, comprehension skills, and writing; and <em>Tri-Math,</em> ages
    6-12 years, uses an alien space intruder, a dinosaur, and a mysterious
    mansion as a part of a math skills program.

<p> Creative Software, of Sunnyvale, California, introduced seven software
    programs for the Commodore 64. Three of them - <em>Joe's Writer, Fred's
    Filer,</em> and <em>Jack's Calc</em> - are components of an integrated
    personal productivity series the company calls the <em>People's
    Choice.</em> Designed for older children and adults, the series
    features a word processor, a file manager, and a spreadsheet. Each
    program will be sold seprately at a suggested price of $49.95.

<p> Also introduced by Creative Software were <em>Crisis Mountain,</em> an
    action game on cartridge; <em>In The Chips</em> (see a review of this
    game elsewhere in this issue), a popular VIC-20 program now available
    on cartridge for the 64, that teaches the player the economics of
    business by pitting him against a rival computer software company;
    <em>I Am The C-64,</em> two three-program disks (sold separately) that
    teach the user about 64 programming, graphics, and sound; and
    <em>Bumblebee,</em> an educational cartridge-based program for children
    six years and older, which introduces the concepts of computer
    programming. Each of the programs sells for $34.95.

<p> Program Design, Inc. (PDI), of Greenwich, Connecticut, announced the
    availability of ten new program translations for the Commodore 64. The
    programs include <em>Analogies, Vocabulary Builder 1</em> and <em>2,
    Reading Comprehension: What's Different?, Preschool IQ Builder 1,
    Memory Builder: Concentration, Story BuilderlWord Master, Code Breaker,
    Number Series,</em> and <em>Shaft Raider.</em>

<p> PDI President John Victor no doubt spoke for quite a few software firms
    when he stated, "We have decided to translate many of our titles into
    the Commodore 64 format...based on its growing popularity in the
    marketplace."

<p> Victor's comment is a good indication of what Commodore 64 owners and,
    to a slightly lesser degree, VIC-20 users will be finding during 1984
    improved and more plentiful software in all areas of computing. The
    Winter CES not only introduced a new line of Commodore computers, it
    revealed more clearly that the company's growing installed base of 64s
    and VIC-20s is fertile ground for software producers.
