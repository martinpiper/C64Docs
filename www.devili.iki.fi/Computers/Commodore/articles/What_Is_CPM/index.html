<h1>What Is CP/M?</h1>

<p>Charles Brannon, Program Editor
</center>

<p>CP/M has been available for the 64 for a while now, but many people
   still don't know what it is or what it does. Commodore 64 CP/M consists
   of a disk and a plug-in cartridge. The disk contains the actual CP/M
   software; the cartridge contains a Z80 microprocessor. In effect, the
   CP/M system turns your 64 into another computer. The new Commodore 128
   incorporates a built-in Z80 chip, and comes complete with the CP/M disk.

<p>Why CP/M? The usual answer is that CP/M opens up a world of software,
   thousands of programs that you can run with the right hardware and
   operating system. But are these programs worth it? Many Apple owners
   would say yes. For a while, Z80 cards were the hottest add-ons available
   for Apples. It seemed logical that Commodore 64 owners would also want
   this power, at a fraction of the price. But CP/M has not caught on so
   far, at least in home computing.

<h2>The CP/M System</h2>

<p>CP/M is an acronym for Control Program for Microcomputers. In essence,
   CP/M is merely an operating system, primarily a disk operating system.
   An operating system is the base software for a computer. It takes care
   of routine system tasks, and provides a link between the computer and
   any other software you may be running.

<p>CP/M began when Gary Kildall, working for Intel, developed a package of
   compactly written subroutines for the tiny 4-bit 4004 microprocessor.
   These useful sub-programs could be used by other programs, simplifying
   the work of a programmer. As technology advanced, CP/M became a
   full-blown operating system for the Intel 8080 microprocessor, and was
   upgraded for the 8080-compatible Zilog Z80 microprocessor. Curiously,
   Intel, the designer of the 8080, was not interested in CP/M, and gave
   Kildall the go-ahead to market it on his own. He started up a company
   called Digital Research. (Digital is still going strong; they recently
   developed GEM, the Macintosh-like operating environment of the new Atari
   ST computers.)

<p>Before CP/M, there was no real operating system for these
   computers, so it was quickly seized upon by most users and manufacturers
   of Z80 computers. There were no successfully competitive operating
   systems, and CP/M easily became a standard. Since almost everyone had
   CP/M, all the Z80 machines had more in common with each other. CP/M made
   it possible for one program to run on many different computers.

<p>Most Z80 computer systems included a keyboard and monitor (or terminal),
   one or two disk drives, and 48K or 64K of memory. These computers were
   never designed to be compatible with each other, but CP/M took care of
   that.

<h2>The BIOS</h2>

<p>Built into CP/M is a library of sub-programs for performing tasks like
   printing a character to the screen. Each computer might use a different
   kind of video display, so some portions of CP/M, the BIOS (Basic
   Input/Output Subsystem) were customized for each machine, but BIOS
   acted the same way on every machine. Because of the BIOS, programmers
   could write their routines to use these universal subprograms instead
   of directly programming their particular computer's video chip. The
   program, if written properly, could run on any computer with CP/M.
   Machine-specific tasks became standardized routines.

<p>A CP/M software market thrived, since developers could write a single
   program that would run on many different computers. Woe be to the
   computer that lacked CP/M. Even though the TRS-80 used a Z8O, it took
   the efforts of third-party developers to bring CP/M to this machine. For
   a while, TRS-80 owners were isolated from the mass market, with a
   separate, smaller, library of software. CP/M was the leader of the 8-bit
   world, and most small businesses used Z80 CP/M computers. CP/M machines
   occupied the niche that the IBM PC and PC clones control today.

<h2>Is It Obsolete?</h2>

<p>The boom went to bust with the introduction of the IBM PC. CP/M machines
   just couldn't keep up with advances in hardware and software. Although
   the IBM PC was not a real breakthrough, it expanded the memory ceiling
   from 64K to 640K. Disk storage jumped from 100K to as much as 370K
   (double-sided disks). The faster and more powerful 8088 microprocessor
   made it easier to write better programs in less time. IBM's open
   architecture encouraged additional power, as more and more hardware
   companies enhanced the IBM with add-ons. The microprocessor used in the
   IBM could not run CP/M, so a whole new standard was forged. (Digital
   Research's CP/M-86 was not available in time for the release of the PC,
   so it failed to establish itself as a standard. Microsoft's MS-DOS,
   which is much like CP/M, beat out CP/M-86 not because it was better, but
   because it was first.) The 8-bit Z80 world of CP/M was replaced by IBM's
   16-bit 8088 world. Software developers jumped on the bandwagon, and CP/M
   was put on the back burner.

<p>Since CP/M is no longer the dominant environment for high-end
   microcomputing (although CP/M machines are still selling today), why is
   it an issue on Commodore machines? It would seem the best bet would be
   an IBM MS-DOS emulator, with an 8088 instead of a Z80. Commodore
   probably went with CP/M because it is built around cheap, proven
   technology. The Z80 simply costs less than the 8088. And CP/M is more
   generalized, easier to adapt, than the MS-DOS used on IBM PCs. CP/M may
   be Commodore's way of crossing over from home computing to small
   business computing. Commodore is even translating some IBM software to
   CP/M, taking advantage of the similarities between CP/M and MS-DOS.

<p>Most CP/M programs are written in 8080 or Z80 machine language. CP/M
   takes care of the minor differences between Z80 machines, but you still
   have to have a Z80 microprocessor. CP/M could be translated to run on
   any computer, such as the 6502, but what good is a 6502 version of CP/M
   if all the programs that run under CP/M are written in Z80 machine
   language?

<h2>Commodore CP/M</h2>

<p>The CP/M cartridge for the 64 is a Z80 with some control circuitry. It's
   designed so that it can take control of the 64's memory. When using this
   cartridge, you're essentially using another computer. The Commodore 64
   CP/M BIOS was actually written in 6510 machine language. The Z80 remains
   in control until it needs to do something like printing a character to
   the screen, or reading a byte from disk. The Z80 then reawakens the
   6510, and puts itself "on hold." The 6510 takes over, finds a request
   from the Z80, acts on it, then transfers control back to the Z80. It's
   unusual, but it works.

<p>However, the 64 does not make a great CP/M computer. To get around
   memory limitations, CP/M resorts to intensive disk access. At the speed
   of the 1541, this makes programs run quite slowly. Also, most CP/M
   computers use a 64 or 80-column wide screen. The Commodore 128, with its
   80-column screen and high-speed disk interface, may be much more
   suitable as a CP/M machine.

<p>The disk that comes with 64 CP/M contains the CP/M operating system,
   plus some utility programs that let you do things like copy files and
   format disks. When you run CP/M, all you really have is an alternate
   DOS. It does nothing on its own, unless you're merely interested in
   programming the Z80 on your own. The missing link is CP/M software.
    
<h2>Where's The Software?</h2>

<p>Thousands of good programs were written for CP/M and are still in use
   today. CP/M users and user groups created a vast amount of public-domain
   software. Most of this software would run under 64 CP/M, if you could
   get it into memory. But the 1541 disk drive can't read a CP/M disk. More
   1541-readable software is necessary for CP/M to have any value at all.
   A large New York user group has been busy transferring public-domain
   software to 1541 format (see the "Horizons" column in the October 1984
   GAZETTE for more information), but the amount of usable CP/M soft-
   ware is still dismally small. Commodore, at the time of this writing,
   has two programming languages you can run under CP/M: Nevada Cobol
   and Nevada Fortran. Soon, Commodore will release a set of business
   tools, the Perfect software series (see <a
   href="../The_Winter_CES_1985/index.html">the CES feature story</a> for more on this).

<p>The new 1571 disk drive helps solve the problem, CP/M for the Commodore
   128 reprograms the disk drive so that it can directly read disks created
   on other disk drives.

<p>Why bother with CP/M at all? There are many good CP/M word processors,
   but there are several word processors for the 64 that are every bit as
   good. There's much more business software available to CP/M machines,
   but most home computerists won't really want to run an Accounts
   Receivable program. When the 64 was first introduced, CP/M looked like
   an excellent way to get around the paucity of available software, but
   there's now almost too many 64 programs to choose from.

<h2>A Business Bargain</h2>

<p>However, CP/M may make the Commodore 128 a bargain buy for small
   businesses. The price of the Commodore 128 with the 1571 disk drive is
   competitive with the IBM PCjr. CP/M software has been around long enough
   to be time-tested and bug-free. There's so much CP/M software that
   there's a good chance you'll find special-interest programs -  programs
   that wouldn't have mass appeal, but could be just what you're looking
   for. For example, some programs are customized for particular
   businesses, such as a bookkeeping system designed especially for a
   dental practice.

<p>CP/M promises a cornucopia of software. Some of this software may be
   useful to you, although most of it probably won't. It remains to be seen
   though, with all the technological advances we're now seeing in hardware
   and software, if anyone really wants to run five-year old software.
