<center><h1>Touring the Commodore 128 Keyboard</h1>

<p>By Morton Kevelson</p>

<p><strong>Last month we presented an inside view of the C-128. Starting
    this month we will take a closeup look at some of the specific features
    which make this new machine a significant improvement over its
    predecessors.</strong>

    The ergonomic considerations in the design of the C-128 keyboard are
    readily apparent. The keyboard's low profile should help reduce
    fatigue by allowing the user's wrists to rest comfortably on the
    table. Touch typists will welcome the raised dimples on the F and J
    home keys, as well as on the 5 key of the numeric keypad. The 2&189; inch
    wide clear space between the keys and the cooling vents is sure to
    become a haven for all sorts of keyboard overlays. All in all, there
    are 92 keys to bewilder the novice.

<p> Observant readers will also note that the main part of the keyboard is
    nearly an exact duplicate of the Commodore 64's. The only notable
    change is the relocation of the function keys to a horizontal
    configuration at the right of the top row. Present 64 owners should
    have very little trouble becoming comfortable with the C-128 layout.

<p> Physical attributes aside, there is a lot more to the C-128 keyboard
    than meets the eye. Hidden beneath the tactile array, under control of
    the new operating system, lurks a multitude of functions designed to
    ease the user's sojourn into the realm of computing with the C-128.

<p> If you have been using a VIC 20 or a C-64, you will already be familiar
    with a good portion of the key- board's capabilities. The full screen
    editor functions in the same way as these machines'. The INST/DEL key
    still eats characters to the left, or when shifted opens spaces to the
    right. The quote and insert modes still operate in the same fashion
    which non-Commodorists find so thoroughly befuddling. The CLR/HOME key
    still moves the cursor to the top left corner of the screen, or when
    shifted clears the entire screen. As with the C-64, text can be
    displayed in 16 colors, as the labels on the 1 to 8 keys indicate.
    These colors are still accessed by holding down the CONTROL key or the
    Commodore logo key. Unlike the C-64, the labels on the number keys now
    indicate both colors which are available for that key. As before, text
    display can be reversed with a CONTROL/9 and restored with a CONTROL/0.

<p> The real power of the C-128 keyboard is in the new editing and control
    features which have been incorporated into the BASIC 7.0 operating
    system. For convenience, we have classified these features into three
    categories: the function keys, the ESCape key sequences, and the
    CONTROL key sequences. Let's take a close look at each in turn.

<h2>THE FUNCTION KEYS</h2>

<p> On power up, eight useful BASIC phrases are preassigned to the C-128
    function keys. These phrases can be viewed by executing BASIC 7.0's new
    KEY command without any parameters. The following list should appear
    on the display.

<pre>
    KEY 1,"GRAPHIC"
    KEY 2,"DLOAD"+CHR$(34)
    KEY 3,"DIRECTORY"+CHR$(13)
    KEY 4,"SCNCLR"+CHR$(13)
    KEY 5,"DSAVE"+CHR$(34)
    KEY 6,"RUN"+CHR$(13)
    KEY 7,"LIST"+CHR$(13)
    KEY 8,"MONITOR'+CHR$(13)
</pre>

<p> Getting this list on the screen serves two purposes. First, it reminds
    you what is programmed into the keys. Secondly, it gives you the
    opportunity to easily change the contents in any of the eight function
    keys. For example, if you are not planning to do any graphic
    programming, you may want to redefine f1. Just cursor up to the "3" in
    KEY 3 and change it to a "1". Hit RETURN and the directory will now be
    displayed by f1. Enter

<pre>
    KEY 3,"OPEN 4,4:CMD4"+CHR$(13)
</pre>

    followed by

<pre>
    KEY 4,"PRINT#4:CLOSE4"+CHR$(13)
</pre>

    and you will be all set for easy printer listing. Note how the numbers
    1 through 8 which immediately follow the KEY statement refer only to
    the function keys. No other keys are affected by this command.

<p> There is one possible disadvantage to having the function keys
    preprogrammed. BASIC programs written for the C-64 do not expect to
    find a lengthy message when examining the function keys. This can be
    easily remedied by reprogramming all eight keys with the following:

<pre>
    FOR I=1 TO 8:KEY I,CHR$(I+132):NEXT
</pre>

    This will place the traditional (for VIC 20 and C-64 users) CHR$ codes
    into the function keys. You will probably want to do this in every
    program which uses the function keys to control program operation.

<h2>ESCape KEY SEQUENCES</h2>

<p> The C-128 has the powerful full screen editor that a veteran Commodore
    user will not feel at home without. This editor has been greatly
    enhanced with the addition of a series of ESCape key commands. The
    result is that the C-128 screen editor approaches the capabilities of a
    full blown text editor. Writing and editing BASIC programs has never
    been easier.

<p> There are 21 ESCape key sequences implemented on the C-128,
    almost one for every letter of the alphabet. These sequences are so
    useful that you will probably want to become familiar with them in a
    hurry. The best way to become acquainted with them is just to use them
    while writing a program. Afterwards, if you really want to see how
    dependent you have become on the new features, just GO 64 and enter the
    same program. Be forewarned, you may be in for a frustrating experience.

<p> Each of the ESCape sequence commands are executed
    by pressing and releasing the ESC key followed by the appropriate
    letter key. Do not hold down both keys at once. For example, pressing
    the ESC key followed by the "A" key places the editor in automatic
    insert mode. Anything you type will automatically push the remainder of
    the display ahead of it. This is a tremendous convenience for
    rearranging text between quotes or for adding temporary commands during program debugging. It is especially useful when you keep
    in mind that the C-128 permits entry of up to 160 characters (four 40
    column lines or two 80 column lines) into a BASIC program line. Note
    that this is not the same as opening a gap by using the INST/DEL key.
    All of the keyboard control functions, such as the cursor keys and the
    CLR/HOME key as well as the INST/DEL key, retain their usual functions.
    In other words, insert mode does not place the screen editor into quote
    mode.

<p> The screen parser has been enhanced in other ways as well. It will now
    link up to a full screen of text at one time. By comparison, the C-64
    is limited to only two screen lines and the VIC 20 handles four screen
    lines. However, trying to enter more than 160 screen characters into a
    single BASIC program line results in a ?STRING TOO LONG ERROR. By
    comparison, exceeding the C-64's two line limit simply resets the
    screen linker to the next two lines. This full screen linking on the
    C-128 must be kept in mind when using the ESCape functions. The erase to end of
    line command (ESC Q) will remove all text from the current cursor
    position to the end of screen text or the next carriage return,
    whichever comes first. The erase to beginning of line command (ESC J)
    works analogously but in the opposite direction. The same is true of
    the move to end of line (ESC K) and move to beginning of line (ESC J).
    On the other hand, the insert a line (ESC I) command is a screen line
    function. Use of this command within a BASIC line opens up one screen
    line while maintaining the line links for BASIC editing.

<p> All of these functions can also be obtained under program control. The
    following sample program illustrates some of the effects which can be
    easily obtained by using the ESCape sequences in PRINT statements:

<pre>
    10 PRINT CHR$(147):REM CLEAR SCREEN
    20 CHAR,14,11,"OFF THE TOP"
    30 CHAR,12,12,"DOWN THE BOTTOM"
    40 CHAR,0,12
    50 FOR I=0TO12
    60 PRINT CHR$(27)"I"CHR$(27)"I";:REM INSERT TWO LINES
    70 PRINT CHR$(27)"V";:REM MOVE SCREEN UP ONE LINE
    80 NEXT
</pre>

<p> Note that CHR$(27) is the ESCape key. Several keystrokes can be saved
    by programming PRINT" &lt; reverse [ &gt; X" where the reversed left bracket
    is obtained by simultaneously pressing CONTROL, SHIFT, and the colon
    keys while in quote mode. The reverse left bracket between quotes in a
    BASIC statement will generate a CHR$(27). This is a useful trick to
    keep in mind for sending escape codes to a printer with a PRINT#
    statement. Note that the ESCape key commands only work when sent to the
    screen. If you want to see how the program works try adding the
    following lines:

<pre>
    65 SLEEP 1
    75 SLEEP 1
</pre>

    The SLEEP command pauses program execution for the specified number of
    seconds. Also note the use of the CHAR command to conveniently position
    the cursor on the screen. The CHAR command is really meant to display
    text on a graphic screen. In this context it is being used as a PRINT
    AT command.

<p> One of the more interesting capabilities of BASIC 7.0 is
    the ability to define windows. Once a window is set, all subsequent
    screen output is restricted to this area. Try the following program:

<pre>
    10 PRINT CHR$(147)
    20 CHAR,10,10,CHR$(27)"T"
    30 CHAR,10,10,CHR$(27)"B"
    40 LIST
</pre>

<p> This will define a screen window whose upper left hand corner is at the
    tenth row and tenth column position. The lower right hand corner will
    be at twentieth row and column position. Note the use of the CHAR
    statement to position the cursor as well as to set the window
    coordinates. Also note the coordinates in the CHAR statement of line
    30.

<p> These are correct as shown. The CHAR statement
    references its coordinates from the upper left hand corner of the
    currently active screen window. Since this has been already defined by
    line 20, we have to take this into consideration for line 30.

<p> To help keep track of the current screen window, BASIC 7.0 includes the
    RWINDOW function. The following sequence of commands:

<pre>
    R=RWINDOW(0)
    C=RWINDOW(1)
</pre>

    will place the number of rows and columns into the variables R and C.

<p> While entering a BASIC program, the window commands can be used to
    partition the screen into a message area and a text area. Just write
    yourself some notes at the top of the screen and set the screen window.
    Continue to enter BASIC program lines. All screen control functions,
    such as clear or home, will not affect the message area. To cancel a
    window just hit the HOME key twice.

<p> Under program control, a window can be used to eliminate the need to
    continuously rePRINT a screen layout. The message area in the window
    can be manipulated as desired without affecting the remainder of the
    screen. Note that only one window can be active at any time.

<p> A word about the scroll commands. Turning scrolling off, with an ESC M,
    causes the cursor to wrap from the bottom of the screen to the top of
    the screen. There is also a NO SCROLL key which according to the
    preliminary documentation is supposed to perform the same function.
    This is not so. We found this key to work as a pause as described
    below.

<h2>CONTROL KEY SEQUENCES</h2>

<p> Turn on your C-128, hold down the CONTROL key, and press G. Surprise!
    If you had the volume turned up on your television or monitor, you were
    rewarded with a pleasant bell tone. This may not seem like much, but if
    I had a nickel for every time someone asked me for a simple way to make
    that noise on a C-64, I would have retired a wealthy man some time ago.
    Commodore has finally implemented the traditional teletype "bell" in
    the C-128 console. The same tone can be produced with a PRINT CHR$(7).

<p> In general the CONTROL functions are not unique to the C-128. Most of
    them will be familiar to present users of the VIC 20 or the C-64. The
    C-128 does have some significant changes and additions to this
    keystroke sequence. Note that unlike the ESCape key sequence you have
    to hold down the CONTROL key while pressing the second key. Also,
    CONTROL key commands can be placed into PRINT statements while the
    screen editor is in quote mode. In contrast, pressing the ESCape key
    while in quote mode will activate the ESCape key sequence.

<p> As mentioned above, a CONTROL left bracket will send an ESCape
    character. Try it. If the editor is not in quote mode, this key
    sequence will initiate the ESCape mode. This little-known key sequence
    will also generate a CHR$(27) on the C-64 and the VIC 20. Of course,
    this has no direct effect on these two machines.

<p> The C-128 has a TAB key on its keyboard right next to the ESCape key.
    Pressing this key generates a CHR$(9), which moves the cursor to the
    next tab stop on the screen. The CONTROL I key combination will have
    the same effect. On the VIC 20 or the C-64, a CHR$(9) will enable the
    character set switch capability. On the C-128 this has been moved to
    CONTROL K ( CHR$(11) ). The disable-character-set-change command has
    also been changed to CONTROL L ( CHR$(12) ), although the old CONTROL H
    ( CHR$(8) ) has no unique C-128 function. Programmers accustomed to
    these codes on the VIC 20 or C-64 should take note.

<p> Getting back to the tab functions, the CONTROL X ( CHR$(24) ) will set
    or clear a tab at the current cursor position. However, to clear all
    tabs you have to use the ESCape Z sequence. The best way to learn about
    the tab stops is just to play with them. Note that a TAB command does
    not wrap the cursor to the following screen line. Tabbing to the end of
    a line simply leaves the cursor at that position.

<p> Another change is worth noting. The CONTROL J ( CHR$(10) ) code
    generates a linefeed without a carriage return. On the C-64 and VIC 20
    both a linefeed and carriage return will be produced.

<p> The remaining unique C-128 CONTROL codes are associated with
    the 80 column display. CONTROL B ( CHR$(2) ) turns underline on.
    However, there is no corresponding CONTROL sequence to turn it off. You
    will have to PRINT CHR$(130) to cancel underline mode. The 80 column
    characters can be set to flash by using a CONTROL 0 ( CHR$(15) ). As
    with underline mode, there is no CONTROL sequence to turn flash off.
    Use PRINT CHR$(143) .

<center><p><table>
<tr><th colspan="3">TABLE OF CONTROL KEY FUNCTIONS</th><tr>
<tr><td>    CONTROL B </td><td> CHR$(2)   </td><td> Turn underline on in 80 column display      </td></tr>

<tr><td>              </td><td> CHR$(143) </td><td> Cancel 80 column flash                      </td></tr>
</table></center>

<h2>THE REST OF THE KEYS</h2>

<p> The top row of the keyboard has a total of 16 keys in groups of four.
    The four function keys on the right have been described above. The
    leftmost grouping includes the ESCape and the TAB keys as well as an
    ALT key and a CAPS LOCK key. The ALT key is intended for use with
    alternate character sets under program control. This will be a topic
    for future discussion. The CAPS LOCK key acts as a SHIFT key only on
    the letter keys. As with the SHIFT LOCK key. the CAPS LOCK key includes
    a mechanical latch to hold it down.

<p> The next group starts with a HELP key. If this key is pressed
    immediately after a BASIC program error, the offending BASIC line will
    be displayed. Starting with the point in the line at which the error
    occurred, the remainder of the line will he displayed in reverse on the
    40 column display and underlined on the 8O column display.

<p> The LINE FEED key moves the cursor down without a carriage return. This
    is the same as the CONTROL J ( CHR$(10) ) described above. The 40/80
    DISPLAY key is another mechanically latched button. It determines the
    display mode on power up or when the reset hutton is depressed.
    Latching it down defaults to the 80 column display. It has no effect
    once the computer is up and running. The NO SCROLL key acts as a pause
    hutton. It comes in handy for freezing a program or directory listing
    in its tracks. Hitting a key a second time restarts the listing. In a
    similar fashion, it also pauses program execution.

<p> The next group consists of four independent cursor keys. These
    duplicate the operation of the cursor keys at the bottom of the
    keyboard. The notable exception is that it is not necessary to SHIFT
    for a cursor up or a cursor right. I found that I have grown so
    accustomed to the old cursor keys that I almost never used the new
    ones. Perhaps the need to reach to the top of the keyboard discourages
    their use.

<p> Finally, a 14-key numeric keypad duplicates the function of the number,
    plus, minus, period/decimal point, and RETURN/ENTER keys. The numeric
    keypad and the four independent cursor keys are electrically different
    from the number keys and the cursor keys on the Commodore 64 subset of
    the keyboard. Although they return the same CHR$ code with a GET
    statement, it is possible to distinguish them by PEEKing an appropriate
    location. (See sidebar on page 52 for details.)

<p> This hardware separation of the keypad from the rest of the keyboard is
    a minor disappointment to C-64 upgraders. If the keypad had been kept
    electrically identical to the number keys on the keyboard it would have
    been usable in C-64 mode as well. This would have allowed the use of
    all existing Commodore 64 programs with the numeric keypad. Keeping the
    keypad compatible could have been easily accomplished by simply
    paralleling the existing contacts. Actually, this would have been
    cheaper to implement than the scheme used. Apparently, Commodore felt
    the extra flexibility offered by the electrical separation was worth
    the extra effort.

<h2>LAST BUT NOT LEAST</h2>

<p> Tucked away on the right side of the C-128. next to the on/off switch.
    is a small square push hutton. It is mounted flush with the surface.
    making accidental activation unlikely. This is a true hardware reset
    button. Pressed on its own, it will bring the C-128 back to its initial
    power up state in the current mode. In conjunction with the Commodore
    logo key, it will force a reset to C-64 mode. 1f the RUN/STOP key is
    held down, the C-128 will come up in the machine language monitor with
    the current BASIC program in memory intact!

<h1>C128 KEYBOARD DISTINCTIONS</h1>

<p> The C-128 sports numeric keypad which should greatly speed up data
    entry in numerically intensive applications, most notably spreadsheets.
    These keys, as well as the discrete cursor keys, duplicate existing
    keys on the main keyboard. There are applications where a numeric
    keypad may be of little or no interest. Instead, various program
    control functions could be assigned to the new keys.

<p> For such applications it would be desirable to distinguish the keypad
    from the number keys on the main keyboard. The traditional ASCII code
    check following a GET will not work, since the same ASCII code wi1l be
    returned by the corresponding keys. For example, pressing a "1" on the
    keyboard or keypad returns an ASCII value of 49. Fortunately, there is
    a simple way for BASIC to distinguish which physical key has been
    pressed.

<p> Locations 211 and 212 are used by the operating system for this
    purpose. The values stored here every sixtieth of a second are unique
    for every key. At address 211
    the SHIFT, Commodore logo, and CONTROL keys are identified. These keys
    will set bits zero, one, and two respectively at this address. If you
    PRINT PEEK(211) a zero will normally be returned. The SHIFT key changes
    this to a one. The logo key returns a two and the CONTROL key results
    in a four. These values are additive, so holding all three keys down
    gives a seven.

<p> The remainder of the keys, with the exception of the RUN/STOP, RESTORE,
    ALT, and 40/80 keys, place a unique value in address 212 when pressed.
    On the C-128 this location contains an 88 when no key is pressed. Press
    any other valid key and a value between 0 and 87 will appear. The table
    above shows the values generated in location 212 by the keys on the
    C-128 keyboard. The following program can be used to reproduce these
    results:

<pre>
    10 DO:GETKEY A$
    20 PRINT ASC(A$);PEEK(212)
    30 LOOP
</pre>

    The same program in BASIC 2.0 on the C-64 or VIC 20 would be:

<pre>
    10 GET A$:IFA$=""THEN10
    20 PRINT ASC(A$);PEEK(203)
    30 GOTO 10
</pre>

<p> Note the change in the PEEKed address. The operating systems on all
    Commodore machines have many similarities. Addresses 203 and 653 on the
    VIC 20 and the C-64 are equivalent to 212 and 211 on the C-128. The
    values in 203 for the C-64 will be the same for the corresponding keys
    in 212 on the C-128. However, the results on the VIC 20 are quite
    different. The shift flag values are the same for all three computers.
    You may want to use the KEY statement on the C-128 to clear the
    function keys before RUNning this program, or strange things may
    result.
