<h1><small>The Winter Consumer Electronics Show</small><br>
    CES<br>
    <small>New Life In The Home Computer Market</small></h1>

<p>Lance Elko, Editor

<p><strong>Just when the doomsayers were looking like soothsayers, the home
   computer industry received a terrific boost from the two remaining "low
   end" manufacturers, Commodore and Atari, at the Winter CES. The new
   micros of 1985 redefine the market by bridging the gap between
   "personal" office computers and home computers.</strong>

<p>A giant leap forward is what some observers called this year's Winter
   Consumer Electronics Show. Unlike the trade shows of the past two years,
   this CES, held January in Las Vegas, showcased some remarkable new
   personal computer technology.

<p>Industry watchers had been anxiously awaiting new machines.

<p>Surely, it was hoped, Commodore would offer some significant hardware,
   something more promising than the Plus/4 and the 16. And what of Jack
   Tramiel, founder of Commodore, now head of Atari? Would he deliver? The
   recent slump had victimized dozens of hardware and software companies,
   and contributed to the demise of Coleco's Adam. It could not continue.

<p>&nbsp;

<p>Driving from the Las Vegas airport into town, it became obvious that
   this CES would be interesting. Along the way were billboards announcing
   that we were in "Atari country." And at Commodore's press conference on
   the opening night, press kits flashing "Bad News for IBM and Apple" were
   distributed. Despite the tendency towards the pie-in-the-sky advertising
   hype of many companies in this market, the "bad news" slogans and the
   swaggering "watch out - we're here" attitude from both Commodore and
   Atari may not miss the mark by much. The new machines represent a major
   step in changing the market and in significantly upgrading the way we
   compute.

<p>Commodore announced two new machines, the 128 Personal Computer -
   externally expandable to 512K - and the portable Commodore LCD. Although
   Commodore would not announce prices for the new machines, Frank
   Leonardi, new vice president of marketing, said that the 128 would
   probably be less than $300 and the LCD less than $600. Commodore expects
   to release the 128 in April or May, and the LCD about one month later.

<p>The 128, contrary to earlier reports that it was simply a 64 with an
   extra 64K of RAM, is being positioned by Commodore as three computers in
   one: a 64, a 128 with 80-columns and RGB (Red, Green, Blue so named
   because it isolates the primary color signals, providing a much sharper
   picture) output, and a CP/M machine. With three microprocessors - a 6510
   (same as the 64), an 8502 chip, which is a slightly enhanced version of
   the 64's 6510, and a Z80 chip for CP/M - Commodore is "trying to meet
   everybody's wish list," notes Commodore software engineer Terry Ryan.
   Commodore 64 owners who upgrade don't lose their software (according to
   Commodore, over 6,000 commercial titles now exist for the 64), those who
   want a readable 80 columns for word processing or spreadsheets can use
   the 128 mode, and CP/M will appeal to those interested in more serious
   business applications. Getting from one mode to another is simple
   enough. From the 128 mode, type GO64. However, once in 64 mode, you must
   reboot the machine to get to the 128 mode. According to a Commodore
   engineer, not a single byte was changed in the Kernal because Commodore
   wanted perfect compatibility with all 64 software. Since GO128 would
   even in the smallest way change the operating system, they chose the
   safer route turn the machine on and type GO128. CP/M is accessed by
   inserting the CP/M 3.0 disk (CP/M is a disk-based operating system)
   which is included with the machine.

<p>The 128 includes a much more powerful BASIC than Commodore owners have
   seen. Named BASIC 7.0 and accessible only in 128 mode, it's derived from
   the BASIC 4.0 found in the venerable CBM 8032 model, but adds some new
   disk commands as well as those of the Super Expander 64. Thus, the
   tedious POKEs required for sound and graphics on the 64 become
   unnecessary with this new machine. However, when in 128 mode, either 40
   or 80 columns must be selected. With 40 columns, both sprites and the
   SID chip can be accessed, thus a Commodore 64 with 122K usable RAM.
   Graphics are not supported in 80-column mode. Also included is a
   built-in machine language monitor, an expanded version (direct access to
   disk is available) of the one packaged with the Plus/4.

<p align="center"><a name="C128_photo"><img src="C128.gif" alt="The
   Commodore 128, three computers in one, offers a new, more serious
   look."></a>

<p>In offering a more serious and powerful computer, Commodore is also
   featuring a new design. At first glance, one is reminded of an IBM-PC.
   It's a smart-looking, sleek machine with an off-white color. The
   keyboard has been thoughtfully designed, especially for those upgrading
   from a 64. With the exception of the function keys, the 64's keyboard is
   intact (see <a href="index.html#C128_photo">photo</a>). But there's a lot more. A numeric keypad is included
   to the right of the main character keys. A top row, from left to right,
   includes ESCAPE, TAB, ALTernate, CAPS LOCK, HELP (similar in function to
   the help key of the Plus/4), LINE FEED, 40/80 DISPLAY, and NO SCROLL.
   Continuing on that row are four cursor keys, providing an alternative
   for those who never liked or got used to those on the 64, and four
   function keys, identical to those on the 64.

<p>The 128 might be seen as an entry into the lower end of the business
   market currently dominated by the IBM-PC and its compatibles. While this
   is arguable, the fact that it seriously upgrades the power and
   flexibility of home computing is not. A huge array of CP/M-based
   software exists, although the PC market has moved away from CP/M in
   favor of MS-DOS (see <a href="../What_Is_CPM/index.html">"What Is CP/M?"</a> for
   more on this). A plus for the new machine is its support of true 80
   columns with RGB output. Unfortunately, Commodore owners with
   composite monitors, such as the 1701, 1702, or 1703, will have to
   upgrade to an RGB monitor to use the 80-columns of the 128. While the
   technology of the 128 is not new, Commodore is offering a solid product
   at a very affordable price.

<p>In support of the 128, Commodore also has a new line of peripherals: the
   1571 Disk Drive, the 1901 Monochrome Monitor, the 1902 RGBI/Composite
   Monitor, and the Commodore Mouse.

   <img src="peripherals.gif" align="right" alt="Among the
   new Commodore peripherals are the Mouse, MPS 802 Printer, 1902
   RGBI/Composite Monitor, and the 1571 Disk Drive.">

   Although prices have not yet been set on any of these new products, they
   should be available at about the same time as the 128. The 1571 drive is
   double-sided (360K storage per disk) and far more intelligent than the
   1541. Although it's serial and reads at the same speed as the 1541 in 64
   mode, it's five times faster when used in 128 mode and almost 12 times
   faster in CP/M mode. Most CP/M software, regardless of format, can be
   used with the 1571. The drive is also compatible with the 64, Plus/4,
   and LCD.

<p>The 1901 is a green screen 80-column monitor designed for business and
   productivity applications such as word processing, data base management,
   and spreadsheets. The 1902, ideally suited for the 128, contains a front
   video switch for composite or RGB display. In 64 mode, composite (40 X
   25 columns) would be selected, thus emulating the display of the 1700
   monitor series, and in 128 or CP/M mode, either composite or RGB (80 X
   25 columns) is available.

<p>The Commodore Mouse, functionally identical to Apple's mouse, provides
   an alternative to a joystick. No price and few details were announced,
   but it should be available for the 128 later this spring.

<p>Commodore also announced the 1670 Modem, a 300/1200 baud modem which
   features auto answer/auto-dial, auto baud, and parity. (Auto baud
   determines the baud rate of another computer and automatically adjusts
   the rate of data transmission.) It's compatible with the 64, Plus/4, and
   128. Although we didn't see the 1670 at the show, it should be available
   this spring. It may be priced at less than $100, a real bargain for a
   1200-baud modem.

<p>&nbsp;

<p><img src="LCD.gif" align="right" alt="The Commodore LCD
   Computer includes a flip-up screen which displays 80 columns and 16 /
   vertical lines.">

   Commodore's second major entry, the LCD, is a portable lap computer,
   with built-in software, modem, and flip-up screen. Commodore was showing
   only prototypes of this machine, so it was difficult to assess the
   software (word processor, file manager, spreadsheet, address book,
   scheduler, calculator, and memo pad), some of which was incomplete.
   However, we did note that the LCD screen is exceptionally fast, and the
   80 X 16 column display is highly readable. The machine runs on four AA
   alkaline batteries or external power, and is easily transportable,
   weighing about three pounds.

<p>The microprocessor used in the LCD is the 65C102, a modified and faster
   version of the 6502. Importantly, Commodore has included several I/O
   ports: RS-232, Centronics parallel, barcode, standard Commodore serial,
   and the 300-baud, auto answer/auto-dial modem. The LCD is programmable
   (BASIC 3.6 is included), and it stores files permanently. If peripheral
   file storage is appropriate, the LCD is compatible with the 1571 and
   1541 disk drives. Curiously, Commodore was showing Sony-standard 3-1/2"
   serial disk drives in use with the LCD, but little information was
   available on these obviously raw prototypes. If Commodore delivers the
   LCD for under $600, it should have a very strong competitive edge in the
   "notebook" computer market.

<p>Several other important announcements were made at Commodore's CES press
   conference. One of the most heartening, for Commodore owners, was the
   establishment of a national service network which includes 160 RCA
   service centers, about 800 Sears stores, and nearly 1300 other outlets
   which include computer stores. Computers and peripherals in or beyond
   warranty can be serviced at these locations beginning in March.

<p>Although a lot of software for the 64 was announced by third party
   companies (see "CES Perspective: Much More For The 64"), Commodore
   introduced only two new packages, both for the 128. <i>Jane</i>,
   developed by the Arktronics Corporation, is icon-based productivity
   software featuring an integrated word processor, spreadsheet, and filing
   system. It's designed for use with a joystick or the Commodore Mouse.
   Reminiscent of Macintosh software, <i>Jane</i> uses pop-up menus and
   windows. For 80-column CP/M mode on the 128, Commodore announced the
   Perfect Series, produced by Thorn EMI. This integrated software line,
   which includes <i>Perfect Writer, Perfect Calc,</i> and <i>Perfect
   Filer</i>, has been on the market in MS-DOS format for the IBM-PC and
   compatibles for some time. No prices were announced for <i>Jane</i> or
   the Perfect Series.

<p>While Commodore has an impressive array of new hardware, Atari has the
   jump on offering a new technology to the low-end market. Jack Tramiel
   and dozens of ex-Commodorians (collectively self-identified as the "New
   Atari" - although others may prefer the "Old Commodore") unveiled six
   new computers, seven printers, three disk drives, and four monitors.

<p>Atari's new computers represent two new series, the XE line (four
   machines upwardly compatible with the Atari 800 and 800 XL), and the
   real showstoppers, the 130ST and the 520ST. The ST machines, driven by
   the 16/32 bit Motorola 68000 microprocessor, the same chip found in the
   Macintosh, can basically be understood as color Macintoshes with a
   choice of input devices (keyboard, joystick, or mouse) and several more
   features. For $599, the 520ST offers 512K RAM, a built-in hard disk
   interface (for $399 you can get an extra 15 megabyte hard disk for
   storage, the equivalent of about 90 Commodore 1541 disks), three screen
   graphics modes (640 X 400 pixels in hi-res), a three-voice sound
   generator with a MIDI interface for communication with external
   electronic instruments such as synthesizers, and a GEM operating system,
   which controls graphics features such as icons, windows, and drop-down
   menus.

<p>The 130ST is a 128K version of the same machine and is priced at $399.
   The XE series includes the 65XE, a 64K enhanced version of the 800XL, to
   sell for $99; the 130XE, a 128K version for under $200; the 65XEP, a
   transportable version of the 65XE which includes a built-in monochrome
   monitor, 3&#189;-inch disk drive, and battery pack, to sell for under $400;
   and the 65XEM, essentially a 65XE with an eight-voice AMY sound chip
   that includes 64 oscillators. Reportedly, the AMY chip can be programmed
   to simulate any musical instrument. This machine will be offered for
   under $200.

<p>The support peripherals for all of Atari's new machines are also priced
   very low in keeping with Jack Tramiel's marketing philosophy. Release
   date for Atari's new hardware is April or May. (For more details on
   Atari's new products, see the CES report in April COMPUTE!).

<p>With Atari and Commodore as the two remaining gladiators in the low-end
   arena, 1985 will prove to be an interesting year. Both Commodore and
   Jack Tramiel are notorious for underselling the competition, and the new
   hardware prices, while surprisingly low, are not really unexpected. But,
   while both companies are claiming Apple and IBM as targets, they're also
   aiming at each other. One source told us that the Atari ST is really
   Commodore's Amiga (also with a 68000 microprocessor), that some of the
   engineers brought to Atari from Commodore by Jack Tramiel knew the Amiga
   well enough to produce a replica. But Commodore denies this, hinting
   that the Amiga is more powerful and different than the ST. All intrigue
   aside, we'll see the Amiga in the market later this year. (For details
   on the Amiga, see "The Editor's Notes" in the November 1984 GAZETTE.)

<p>We're sure to see more from Commodore and Atari at the Summer CES in
   June, and possibly even before then. But their announcements at this CES
   are significant if only for one reason: much more power at much lower
   cost.
