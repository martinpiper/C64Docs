<p>Over 36,00 people filled the Dallas Convention Center on June 13 to 16 to
attend the biggest National Computer Conference ever. Virtually every
manufacturer in the computing field was there either to exhibit or to take
notes. But waht made this yar's NCC different from past shows was the NCC
sponsored Personal Computing Fair and Exposition held concurrently in the
Convention Center.

<p>Manufacturers of personal computers and related products turned out in
force to display their wares before large crowds. Hopeful hobbyists and
experimenters exhibited their home computer projects at the Personal
Computing Fair (devoted entirely to noncommercial invidual and group owned
projects), and vied to win prizes.

<p>Both sections of the show featured extensive seminars and panel
discussions about present and future uses of computers; personal computing
club representatives met to discuss the possibility of forming a National
Club Congress.

<p>It was gratifying to see long term NCC veterans mingling with hacres
from all over the country in a congenial atmosphere filled with
microcomputers that played games and dazzled the eye with elegant color
graphics. One group learned from other and ideas were exchanged at
extremely high rates.

<p>Seeing everything at the show was quite a challenge: some 300 manufacturers
were spread out over five football field's worth of exhibits upstairs. And
the main floor exihibits were <i>big</i>: Data General, for example,
brought an entire working planetarium controlled by a Nova minicomputer and
capable of holding 50 people inside. Many of the booths were two stories
high; others took up areoas of 30 by 60 feet or more

A lengthy waiting list is predicted for the unit.</i></td><td rowspan="3" align="center" valign="top"><img src="photo_5.gif" alt="Photo 5"></td></tr>

<p>There was much to see in the Personal Computing section downstairs, too:
Commodore's new PET microcomputer, a variety of the latest video games
programs (including atank game for micros), new music programs, talking
computers, software packages for FORTRAN, business programs, floppy disks,
and so on.

<p>Summarizing the entire show is almost impossible: we found it inspiring
(and sometimes frustrating!) to look at the some of the state of the art
devices, such as high resolution video displays, on view in the main
exhibit hall.

<p>From the looks of this convention, the computer industry is in good
shape, and we look forward to an even bigger and better show next year.
