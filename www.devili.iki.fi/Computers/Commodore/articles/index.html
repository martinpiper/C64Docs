<p>Here is a little collection of interesting articles. It consists of
   several articles scanned from old magazines, mostly from COMPUTE!'s
   Gazettes. These articles deals with various subjects, while primary
   target was the Commodore 128 - simply because I just got one. But there
   is some other interesting machines mentioned, like the Commodore LCD.
