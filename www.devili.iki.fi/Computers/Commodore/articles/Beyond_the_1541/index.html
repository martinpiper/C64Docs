<h1>Beyond the 1541<br>
	<small>Mass Storage For The 64 And 128</small></h1>

<p>Selby Bateman, Features Editor
</center>

<p><strong>A 3.5-inch microdisk drive for the 64? A hard disk storage
	system for the 128? The continuing evolution of personal computers is
	causing major shifts in the kinds of data storage devices being used.
	There are signs that even the familiar 5-1/4-inch floppy disk may
	eventually go the way of punch cards and paper tape storage methods.
	Here's a look at what's headed your way in the emerging microcomputer
	industry Commodore market.</strong>

<p> Consider the 1541 disk drive: It's been called a "toy," a "lumbering
	hippo," and "the albatross of the Commodore 64." Business users
    impatiently deride its slow operating speed. Alternative devices and
	software speedup schemes have been offered by other manufacturers. And
	even defenders of the 1541 have been known to drum their fingers
    waiting for it to load data at a relatively slow 512 bytes per second.

<p> Yet despite the insults hurled at the 1541, one Commodore source
	estimates that as many as three-quarters of the five million 64s and
	VIC-20s sold worldwide are used with 1541s (or the earlier 1540
    drives). The slow but relatively inexpensive 1541 became another salvo
	in the continuing battle to bring down prices and spur consumer sales
	of computers.

<p> It's difficult to believe that the 64 and the 1541 are almost four
	years old. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 1982,
	Commodore introduced its new 64K computer at a suggested retail of
	$595, a breakthrough in price and power. Commodore also introduced a
	companion for the 64: the 1541 drive, a direct descendant of earlier
	drives used with the VIC-20 and PET computers.

<p> When first released, the 1541 sold for almost $600. But prices dropped
	swiftly, just as they did for the 64 itself. Soon, a 1541 could be
	bought for $399, then $299, and $250. Today, a new 1541 can be
	purchased from some vendors for as little as $149, and used 1541s
	frequently are available for $99.

<p> But for many 64 users, the 1541 was not their first storage device.
	Commodore's Datassette tape recorder, a digital cousin of the common
	audio cassette tape recorder, was offered at even less expense.

<p> Why tape recorders? The emerging microcomputer industry borrowed ideas
	from mainframe computer systems, and tape storage proved to be a
	natural - inexpensive and dependable. The problem with tape storage is
	its speed.

<p> A tape recorder is a sequential access device. That is, the magnetic
	information is read sequentially from the tape as it passes in front of
	a stationary read/write head. To get to a particular program on the
	tape, several other programs may have to slide by the tape head before
	it reaches the one you want.

<p> On the other hand, a disk drive is a random access device. The
	read/write head moves across a spinning disk, much like the stylus of a
	record player moves across the face of an album. The result is a much
	more efficient means of data access than a cassette tape. Although the
	1541 is slower than other computers' disk drives, it is much faster
	than a Datassette.

<p> Despite its slowness, the Datassette and some third-party cassette
	recorders introduced thousands of computer users to data storage in the
	early years of the Commodore 64 and the VIC-20. Commercial software was
	usually offered in both tape and disk format (and frequently in plug-in
	ROM cartridges). But during the past year and a half, virtually all
	commercial software vendors have forsaken tape versions of 64 software.
	The thousands of commercial programs available for the 64 are almost
	all on disk. And at Commodore, stacks of Datassettes sit boxed and
	ready with no place to go. Technology has rendered them obsolete.

<p> A computer as inexpensive as the 64 had to have a disk drive in the
	same price range. To cut costs, Commodore equipped the VIC and 64
	drives with serial data transmission ports, much slower than the IEEE
	parallel ports used in the earlier PET disk drives. Adding to the
	problem, Commodore engineers reportedly had to slow very slightly the
	original data transfer speed of the 1540 (designed for the VIC) in
	order to make the new 1541 drive compatible with the 64 - an
	engineering concession to marketing plans for the computers.

<p> A serial connection moves only one bit of data at a time, rather than
	multiple bits sent simultaneously in a parallel connection. Further
	slowing serial transfer between the 64 and the 1541 is the fact that
	the VIC and 64 (and Plus/4 and 16) require the computer's main
	microprocessor to disassemble a byte of information into its individual
	bits, add several controlling bits, and then send the information. This
	takes extra time for the microprocessor. A special-purpose hardware
	serial device could accomplish this much faster.

<p> That's exactly what Commodore has done in the new 128 computer and its
	1571 disk drive. Special hardware takes care of most communication
	handling (the first CIA chip takes on extra work), freeing the
	microprocessor from these chores and thus increasing the speed of
	transfer. Commodore calls this serial fast mode as opposed to the
	64/1541 slow mode. As 1571 owners know, their disk drives can actually
	work at different speeds, depending on whether it's in 1571 mode for
	the 128, 1541 mode for the 64 or 128, or CP/M mode.

<p> A number of companies have produced Commodore-compatible disk drives in
	an attempt to improve on the 1541.

    <img src="BCD.gif" alt="The BCD/5.25 disk drive from Blue Chip
    Electronics is one of several Commodore-compatible drives for the 64
    that offer faster speeds than Commodore's 1541 drive." align="left">

	The BCD-5.25 drive from Blue Chip Electronics, the Indus GT from Indus
	Systems, the MSD SD-1 (single drive) and SD-2 (dual drives) from MSD
	Systems, the Enhancer 2000 from The Comtel Group, and the Clone II disk
    drive from HBH Sales Corp. are among the best known of these
	alternative disk drives. As a group, they offer considerably faster
	operating speeds and a variety of extra features.

<p> But, as some GAZETTE readers have discovered, these "Commodore
	compatible" drives aren't always "1541 compatible," a big difference
	when it comes to loading and using some commercial software. There are
	even a few commercial programs that won't load on the 1571 in 1541
	mode. Compatibility problems usually crop up when a commercial software
	producer has copy-protected disks in such a way that the program check
	for the ROM (Read-Only Memory) routines to be found in the 1541 drive.
	Since the other disk drive makers are forbidden by copyright law from
	copying Commodore's 1541 ROM exactly, they have slight differences in
	the way they operate. Sometimes, these differences are enough to make
	the software fail to load properly. Although most of the drive
	manufacturers do extensive testing of commercial software before
	releasing the drive, new protection schemes arrive every day.

<p> But for many users, the problem of commercial software incompatibility
	is not sufficient to keep them from using these faster and often more
	reliable drives.

<p> Another way around the 1541's weaknesses has been offered by several
	software manufacturers: cartridge- or disk-based programs which speed
	up the data transfer rate between the computer and the disk drive.
	Among these are the Fast Load cartridge from Epyx, the MACH-5 cartridge
	and disk from Access, the 1541 Flash! hardware adapter from Skyles, and
	the Kwik-Load! disk from DataMost. The GAZETTE has also offered its own
	quick-load programs for the 64, "TurboTape" and "TurboDisk" in the July
	1985 issue.

<p> A less common approach to storage devices for the 64 has been taken by
	Entrepo of Sunnyvale, California, maker of the Quick Data Drive (QDD).
	The QDD is a stringy floppy system, a high-speed cassette tape in a
	small wafer. As with a cassette tape player, like the Datassette, the
	QDD is a sequential access storage device. But the tape is a continuous
	loop; it doesn't have a beginning and end, so it doesn't have to be
    rewound to the beginning, it just fast-forwards until the program is
	found. Programs can load considerably faster than a regular cassette
	tape   and even the 1541   because data is transferred at a faster
	rate. To the computer, the QDD acts more like a disk drive than a tape
	drive.

<p> Although Entrepo has been transferring a number of third-party
	commercial software programs on wafers for use with the QDD, software
	vendors aren't likely to support this format unless a large enough
	installed base of QDDs makes it worthwhile. Still, at a suggested
	retail price of $84.95, the QDD offers an innovative, relatively
	inexpensive data storage system for Commodore owners. (For more
	information on the QDD, see the November 1985 ''Horizons'' column.)

<p> Another Commodore drive, the SFD-1001, is actually an older model PET
	disk drive that can be used with your 64 or 128 (in 64 mode). Priced at
    under $400, the SFD-1001 is a one-megabyte double-sided, double-density
	parallel drive that requires an IEEE parallel interface and a Commodore
	PET computer cable to work with your 64. These drives are no longer in
	production, and were first built by Commodore for the PET computers, so
	they're not meant to run 64 commercial software made for the 1541.
	However, Progressive Peripherals and Software has acquired the
	marketing rights to the remaining stocks of these drives.

<p> One of the fastest growing trends in the data storage area is the move
	toward 3.5-inch microfloppy disks, adopted for Apple's Macintosh and
	for the new 520 ST from Atari and the Amiga from Commodore. Encased in
	rigid plastic, these disks are more rugged, faster, and pack more data
	per disk (usually about 400K single-sided, 800K double-sided) than most
	standard 5-1/4-inch disks (approximately 174K on a 1541 unformatted
	disk). Industry rumors are that IBM may soon adopt the 3.5-inch
	standard for one or more of its new computers, which would give this
	format an even greater boost. During 1985, Apple Computer announced a
	3.5-inch drive to be used with its Apple IIe and IIc computers, as
	well.

<p> Will Commodore also offer a 3.5-inch disk drive for use with the 64
	and/or 128? So far, company officials have been against the idea,
	concentrating their efforts on getting the new 128 and Amiga computers
	out. But, from a technical standpoint, Commodore could market a
	3.5-inch drive for the 64 or 128 tomorrow, say several sources.

<p> At last summer's CES show in Chicago, Commodore announced to the press
	its intention to market an LCD laptop portable computer, which could be
	used with an external 3.5-inch drive. Although the laptop portable has
	been shelved for the time being, Commodore is said to be looking at the
	3.5-inch drive for use with the 64 and/or 128. With the 64's immense
	base of 5-1/4-inch software, why bother with 3.5-inch media? Certainly,
	software companies would have to see a potential for a large installed
	base of 3.5-inch drives before converting their products to that
	format. But, as the 3.5-inch trend continues to gather speed, some
	developers feel there may be an emerging market for that type of
	storage device. Apple's decision to offer a 3.5-inch disk drive for the
	Apple II computers, which also have a huge base of 5-1/4-inch software,
	may help Commodore decide in favor of releasing the drive.

<p> Commodore is also holding off on the release of the previously
	announced 1572 dual disk drive for the 128. No price had been
	announced, but the 1572 was to feature two 5-1/4-inch drives for 64,
	128, or CP/M modes. Each of the drives would read double-sided,
	single-density disks with up to 340K (formatted) memory in 128 mode,
	and double-sided, double-density disks with up to 410K (formatted)
	memory in CP/M mode.

<p> One company, Blue Chip Electronics, plans to make and sell a 3.5-inch
	drive for the Commodore 64 as early as the first quarter of 1986.
	Called the BCD/3.5, the drive will work with the 64 and with the 128 in
	64 mode, according to John Rossi, president of Blue Chip. To be priced
	at under $100, the BCD/3.5 is supposed to carry 250K per disk and let
	you copy programs from the 1541 5-1/4-inch format to 3.5-inch format.
	Prices for 3.5-inch disks and drives will be dropping across the
	computer industry in 1986, says Rossi, especially if IBM adopts such a
	drive, as expected.

<p> Blue Chip is also planning an alternative to the 128's 1571 drive.
	Although still in prototype stage at this writing, the unit is
	tentatively called the BCD/128, will sell for under $200, and will
	operate in all three 128 modes	 64, 128, and CP/M.

<p> Another company planning a replacement for the 1571 is World Disk
	Drives of Laguna Hills, California. The company originally planned to
	market a 64-compatible disk drive, the Mirage, but shelved the idea and
	switched to the potential market for 128 drives. Tentatively called the
	CXT-1281, the drive is to be sold for just under $300, and operates in
	all three modes. In addition, the drive is planned to read
	single-density CP/M disks (such as those on Osborne computers) as well
	as the double-density CP/M disks which the 1571 drive reads. The unit
	is also expected to come with a built-in parallel printer interface
	that features full Commodore graphics and conversion from Commodore
	ASCII to standard ASCII.

<p> To be marketed as a part of the CXT-1281 (possibly for an extra charge)
	is a ROM configuration program which will let the drive automatically
	check for what kind of CP/M disk is installed (Kaypro, Osborne, etc.).
	Once classified, the drive will configure the keyboard to emulate the
	appropriate computer's keyboard commands. The drive should be available
	by the time you read this.

<p> For the maximum in data storage, personal computers need the capacities
	of a hard disk, which can hold 10, 20, even 100 megabytes (MB) of
	information. To put things in perspective, it would take 60
	single-sided 1541 disks (or 30 double-sided 1571 disks) to hold the
	information stored on one 10-MB hard disk.

<p> Commodore was scheduled to announce a hard disk for the 64 at last
	summer's CES show, but held back at the last minute. At this time,
	according to one Commodore source, there are no plans to market a hard
	disk for either the 64 or the 128. Again, according to several sources,
	marketing considerations won out over technical capability.

<p> Two companies that do sell hard disks for the Commodore 64 also plan to
	sell hard disks for the 128 in all three modes.

<p> <img src="Lt_Kernel.gif" alt="Fiscal Information's $1595 Lt. Kernel is a 10-megabyte hard disk drive for the Commodore 64 and 128 computer" align="right">

	Fiscal Information, Inc., has released an improved version of its Lt.
	Kernel hard disk drive for the 64 (and 128 in 64 mode). Up to 16 64s
	can be linked with the Lt. Kernel, which comes in 10MB or 20MB versions
	and is 43 times faster than the 1541. Priced at $1595 for the 10MB
	single unit, the new Lt. Kernel carries its own self-contained DOS
	(disk operating system) and uses none of the 64's RAM. The unit
	connects to the computer's cartridge port and transparently implements
	all of the 1541's DOS functions.

<p> Hard disks have been used with 64s in a variety of areas, primarily for
	bulletin boards, retail stores, police department databases, and
	software development houses, says Lloyd Sponenburgh, director of
	hardware development for Fiscal Information, Inc. Although the present
	Lt. Kernel doesn't support the 128 in CP/M and 128 modes, the company
	hopes to have it working in all three modes by early January,
	Sponenburgh says.

<p> Computer Specialties, Inc. (CSI) has a hard disk for the Commodore 64,
	the CSI 10C hard disk drive system, a 10MB drive which also sells for
	$1595. The CSI 10C works in both 64 and 128 modes, can be linked to as
	many as eight computers, and has an intelligent backup function which
	lets the hard drive know what kind of backup drive is attached.

<p> Although hard disk drives have generally been too expensive for many
	home users, that's changing. For example, a new hard drive for the
	Atari 520 ST computer should be available for around $699 by the time
	you read this. As technology changes and prices drop, it's possible to
	see hard disks for the 64 and/or 128 in that price range during 1986.

<p> The power and range of data storage devices are changing as personal
	computers become more sophisticated and new technologies emerge. Among
	the advanced storage options already in use with some computers are
	hard disk drives with removable cartridges, and the Bernoulli Box, a
    flexible-disk system with the power of a hard drive that's based on a
	novel air-cushion technology. On the horizon is a growing array of
	optical disk media that use low-power lasers to read digital
	information from compact discs. Many computer experts agree that this
	laser-driven technology will one day supercede the magnetic media we
	use today.

<p> For Commodore owners, it's not time to think about throwing away all
	the 5-1/4-inch disks. But with data storage formats such as the
	3.5-inch disk and hard drives moving into the personal computer
	marketplace, the future of the 5-1/4-inch floppy disk may be a short
	one.
