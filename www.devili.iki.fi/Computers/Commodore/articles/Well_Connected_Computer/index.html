<h1><small>Using Commodore 64 Peripherals On The 128</small><br>
    The Well Connected Computer</h1>

<p><strong>If you're considering buying a 128 and have already spent a lot
    of money on peripherals for you Commodore 64, you may be concerned
    about compatibility. Will your old printer and monitor and disk drive
    suffice? For most applications the answer is yes.</strong>

<p> Peripheral compatibility between the Commodore 64 and 128 is not as
    simple an issue as it was between the VIC-20 and 64, though, in most
    cases, the peripherals are interchangeable. The only real problem arises if
    you want to take full advantage of the 128's special features, like
    its 80-column screen and CP/M capability.

<p> One of Commodore's prime objectives in designing the 128 was "to
    maintain hardware and software compatibility with the 64," according to
    preliminary technical documentation. With millions of active 64 users
    out there, and hundreds of popular software packages and peripherals in
    place, that certainly makes sense.

<p> With one exception, the ports and switches on the 128 are identical to
    those found on the 64. Starting at the lower right side of the 128,
    let's move around counterclockwise and have a look at which peripherals
    work with the 128.

<h2>Joystick ports</h2>

<p> Control ports 1 and 2, as they're labeled on the 128, read the signals
    sent to the computer by either switches or potentiometers (a
    potentiometer is like the dimmer switch in an overhead dining room
    light fixture). These signals are sent out from joysticks, paddles,
    trackballs, graphics tablets, light pens and Commodore's new mouse,
    which is like an upside-down trackball.

<p> There was a bit of an outcry when the Plus/4 and 16 were released,
    because the machines' joystick ports were not compatible with existing
    joysticks. But any of the above that you might have purchased for your
    VIC or 64 will work on the 128.

<h2>On/Off Switch</h2>

<p> This has the same function as the 64, to turn on the computer. There's
    also a reset switch (not available on the 64) that works basically the
    same as on/off switch.


<h2>Power Supply Port</h2>

<p> You can't use the original two-pin VIC-20 power supply on a Commodore
    64 (although the newer VICs use the same seven-pin plug as the 64), and
    you can't use a 64 power supply on a 128 because of their different
    voltage and current requirements. The power supply is not really
    considered a peripheral - it's a standard accessory that comes with
    the machine.

<h2>Expansion Port</h2>

<p> Again, this is not really a peripheral port, since it's most often used
    for cartridge-based software. Many cartridges are auto-booting, meaning
    you plug it in, turn on the computer, and it boots itself up without a
    RUN or SYS command.

<p> Though the 128 automatically starts out in 128 mode, it can detect the
    presence of a cartridge for the 64 and switch into 64 mode, allowing
    the cartridge to auto-boot. Voice synthesizers, some of which plug into
    this port, could be considered peripherals. There appears to be no
    problem using them on the 128.

<h2>Cassette Port</h2>

<p> Two types of peripherals can be plugged into this port: the Commodore
    64 Datassette and certain printer interfaces which draw power from
    one of the pins. A VIC or 64 Datassette is compatible (but not the
    cassette drive designed for use with the Plus/4 and 16) as are the
    printer interfaces.

<h2>Serial Port</h2>

<p> This port is also used for printer interfaces, as well as for disk
    drives. Both the 1541 and 1571 disk drive have two ports on the back:
    One receives the cable running from the computer, and the other can
    act as a substitute serial port for additional disk drives or printers.
    If you have both a printer and a disk drive, you plug the disk drive
    cable into the serial port of the computer and the printer cable into
    the back of the disk drive. The disk drive, in effect, relays commands
    from the printer to the computer and vice versa. Compatibility does not
    appear to be a problem, although you may have to turn off your printer
    before powering on or resetting the 128.

<p> However, the speed of your drive will vary, depending on the
    combination of computer/disk drive. The new protocol on the 1571 makes
    a combination of the 128/1571 very fast (and it's even faster when the
    128 is in CP/M mode). Combinations of 64/1541, 64/1571, and 128/1541
    all yield relatively slow transfer speed (300 characters per second in
    64 mode, as opposed to approximately 2000 in CP/M mode).

<p> Also, the 1571 can read double-sided disks, where the 1541 cannot. This
    may cause some software incompatibility in the future if developers
    create software that uses both sides of a disk.

<h2>Video Port</h2>

<p> This port, which sends a signal to either a composite or a monochrome
    monitor, is wired exactly the same on both the 64 and 128. Whatever
    you're using now with your 64 should work fine on the 128.

<p> Commodore's 1660 modem also connects to the audio pin on this port in
    order to emulate touchtone dialing sounds. It works with both machines.

<h2>Low/High Switch</h2>

<p> This switch is the same on both computers. It simply lets you choose
    which channel, 3 or 4, will receive a signal if you're using a TV for
    video display.

<h2>RF Port</h2>

<p> If you don't own a monitor, this is where you plug in your television.
    The cable that plugs into the TV/computer switch box plugs in here on
    both the 64 and 128.

<h2>RGBI Port</h2>

<p> This port does not exist on the 64. On the 128, it sends out two
    signals. Both allow for 80 columns, one in monochrome (black and white)
    and one in color.

<p> If 80 columns in monochrome is good enough for you, you can continue to
    use either a composite monitor, like the 1701 or 1702, or a monochrome
    monitor. But if you want 80 columns in color, you'll need an RGBI
    monitor like Commodore's new 1901.

<p> At least two companies have manufactured monitor cables that give you
    80-column capability. Cardco's C128/80 ($9.95) is a single cable that
    connects the 128's RGBI port to the video-in plug on a monitor. To
    switch from 40 to 80 columns, you unplug the 40-column input before
    inserting the 80-column plug (or, if you have a Commodore monitor, you
    can use the front connections for 80-columns and the rear connections
    for 40, and flip the switch on the back of the monitor to go between
    the two screens). Microvation's 40/80 Switch ($14.95) consists of a
    small switch box with three cables running out. One plugs into the
    monitor, and the other two connect to the 128: one into the video port
    and one into the RGBI port. By flipping the switch on the interface,
    you can switch between 40 and 80 columns. (For more information,
    contact Cardco, 300 S. Topeka, Wichita, KS 67202, or Microvations, 8920
    Arcturus Way, San Diego, CA 92126.)

<p> Unfortunately, there is no practical way to get 80 columns if you're
    using a television set.

<h2>User Port</h2>

<p> This port is used almost exclusively for plugging in direct-connect
    modems. The compatibility situation looks good here, as long as you are
    telecommunicating in 64 or 128 mode.

<p> But the original release of CP/M for the 128 does not support
    telecommunications. This is not a problem with the hardware, but with
    the software. The upgraded CP/M release has reportedly corrected this,
    and includes a terminal program called MDM730, which should be
    compatible with all Commodore modems. (For further information, see
    "128 Update: An Improved CP/M" on page 38.)

<p>&nbsp;

<p> Though compatibility should create very few problems as you upgrade to
    a 128, you may run into some annoying minor problems. For instance,
    some software packages require you to plug a dongle (a small plastic
    box used for copy protection) into the user port before running the
    program. Because of the differences in the plastic casing of the 64
    and 128, it may be difficult to plug in the dongle. But remember, the
    128 was designed to allow 64 owners to upgrade without having to
    sink a lot of money into new peripherals, and Commodore's plan appears
    to have been successful.
