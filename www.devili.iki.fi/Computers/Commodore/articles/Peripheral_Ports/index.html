<h1>Commodore Peripheral Ports</h1>
    Ottis R. Cowper, Technical Editor
</center>

<p> Commodore computers provide their users with a variety of methods for
    communicating with the outside world. The devices from which the
    computer receives input or to which it sends output (or both) are
    generically called peripherals, and the connectors where peripherals
    are attached to the computer are referred to as ports. Each of the
    several ports has distinctive characteristics that make it suitable for
    particular applications. For some, the computer's operating system the
    ROM which controls the machine's functions   provides routines that
    handle much or all of the "dirty work" of communicating with devices
    attached to those ports. To use other ports, you must program all the
    necessary support routines yourself. That task can range from very easy
    (for example, reading a joystick) to quite complex (interfacing with a
    parallel printer through the user port, for example). Here's a rundown
    of the features of all the ports:

<h2>The Serial Port</h2>

<p> For most users, the serial port is the major data
    artery of the computer. As the connection point for disk drives and
    printers, it's the port through which most information exchanges take
    place. This is the one port that is the same on the VIC, 64, Plus/4,
    and 16. Well, almost the same - there are some signal timing
    differences. The VIC transfers data at a slightly faster rate than the
    others, which is one of the reasons the VIC is listed as incompatible
    with the 1526 printer, and why the original 1540 disk drive was only
    for the VIC. Obviously, this port is bidirectional - data can flow both
    in and out with equal ease.

<p> The signal format used to exchange data over the six lines provided
    through this port is unique to Commodore. The format should not be
    confused with the more standard RS-232 serial communications format
    used by numerous peripherals; RS-232 communication is handled through
    the user port (see below). The serial port is essentially a stripped
    down version of the parallel IEEE-488 port used for most data
    communications in Commodore's earlier PET/CBM models. As the term
    serial implies, data can be transferred only one bit at a time (and in
    only one direction at a time, either in or out). Three of the other
    lines control the direction of data flow, and whether the signals on
    the data line are to be interpreted as data or as commands to the
    peripheral device. The computer's RESET line is also present at this
    port, which explains why the disk drive resets whenever the computer is
    turned on or off.

<p> The operating system fully supports communications through this port.
    By addressing a peripheral attached to this port with a device number,
    and using OPEN, CLOSE, PRINT#, INPUT# and related routines provided by
    the operating system, you can avoid worrying with the details of
    controlling the individual signal lines. Any peripheral addressed with
    a device number between 4 and 31 (the highest device number allowed) is
    assumed by the computer to be connected to this port.

<p> Commodore has established several standards for device numbers:
    Printers are usually device 4, although some can be changed to device
    5, the 1520 Printer/Plotter is designed to be device 6, and device
    numbers 8 and above usually refer to disk drives. Device 8 is the
    default number for the disk drive, and almost all software assumes the
    disk drive will have this device number; device 9 is the most common
    choice for a second drive. Commodore 1541 drives allow you to select
    any device number via software, or numbers 8 - 11 via hardware.

<p> The use of a unique signal format for communication with the disk drive
    is not unusual; almost all computer manufacturers use a proprietary
    disk interface compatible only with their own products. What is unusual
    is that this same nonstandard format is also used for communications
    with printers. Since so much software assumes that printers will be
    connected through the serial port (as device 4), most third-party
    interfaces for non-Commodore printers also attach to this port. These
    interfaces act as interpreters, reading the Commodore-format serial
    signal from the port and converting it to the more standard parallel
    (eight bits at a time) format used by most printers.

<h2>The Memory Expansion Port</h2>

<p> This is often referred to as the cartridge port, since ROM cartridges
    are the peripherals most often attached through this connector. In
    the VIC, this is also the port through which RAM memory expanders are
    added. The lines available at this port include most of the address,
    data, and control lines of the microprocessor chip that is the heart of
    the computer. Thus, any peripheral which needs to be intimately tied to
    the workings of the computer - for example, ROM that must be
    addressed by the microprocessor - is connected through this port. The
    operating system does not support any devices through this port; in
    essence, anything attached here is no longer a peripheral, but part of
    the computer itself.

<p> This port is present on the VIC, 64, Plus/4, and 16. Many of the same
    lines are available on corresponding pins of the expansion port
    connectors used in the VIC and 64, but the connectors themselves are
    different sizes, so cartridges designed for the 64 cannot be used on
    the VIC, and vice versa. The Plus/4 and 16 have identical 50-pin
    connectors for this port (as opposed to the 44-pin connectors used in
    the VIC and 64), so presumably there will be some compatibility of
    cartridges for these models, although no VIC or 64 cartridges or memory
    port peripherals can be used.

<p> Examples of other types of devices which attach through this port are
    the CP/M cartridge for the 64, which contains a second microprocessor
    that takes complete control of the 64's RAM and input/output chips, and
    the Magic Voice speech module, which is attached through this port
    because it contains additional ROM to allow the computer to support
    voice output.

<h2>The User Port</h2>

<p> This port (sometimes called the RS-232 or modem port) was designed
    with the experimenter in mind. Just as the memory expansion port
    gives you access to a number of the microprocessor's control lines,
    this port gives you access to many of the control lines of one of the
    interface adapter chips (VIAs for the VIC or CIAs for the 64). Using
    these lines, a wide variety of peripherals could be connected, since
    both serial and eight-bit parallel communications are available.

<p> Unfortunately, most of this flexibility goes unused since it isn't
    supported by the operating system. Most home computer users today are
    more interested in software than in tinkering with hardware projects,
    so this port is most frequently used for its one function supported by
    the operating system: RS-232 serial communications.

<p> RS-232 is the name of the most common serial communications standard.
    If you use the operating system to address device 2, data directed to
    that device will be transferred through the user port in an
    approximation of RS-232 format. Actually, the signal format is true
    RS-232, but the voltage levels are different from those prescribed. The
    standard calls for voltage levels of -12 to +12 volts, and the user
    port only provides levels of 0 to +5 volts. Adapters are available -
    from Commodore and other sources - to convert the signal voltage to the
    proper levels. These adapters are not necessary if you're going to use
    Commodore's modems, but are required to use any standard RS-232
    equipment.

<p> The 24 pins of this port have a similar configuration on both the VIC
    and 64, so many devices designed to interface to this port can be used
    on either computer, although the software to run the devices will
    generally be different. The VICmodem and Automodem, for example, work
    with either model. The Plus/4 appears to have the same 24-pin
    connector, but the computer casing around the connector is smaller, so
    neither the VICmodem nor Automodem can be plugged into the Plus/4.
    (Commodore's new 1660 modem works with the VIC, 64, and Plus/4.) The
    Commodore 16 has no user port, so it is as yet unclear if or how a
    modem may be used with that computer.

<p> Since eight-bit parallel data communications are available through this
    port, it might seem surprising that it's not commonly used for
    interfacing with printers. After all, it would appear on the surface
    to be simpler to write a machine language program to simulate the
    commonly used Centronics parallel format through this port, than to go
    to all the trouble of designing the hardware interface to convert the
    data from the serial port to the proper parallel format.

<p> The reason this isn't often done is that almost all Commodore software
    expects the printer to be device 4 on the serial port, and in the long
    run it proves easier to seek a hardware solution to allow you to use
    the built-in operating system routines as provided in ROM. That way,
    you don't have to worry about having to load your printer handler
    routine into memory before you can use it, finding a safe place in RAM
    to store the handler routine, etc.

<p> For more information on interfacing through the user port, see the
    article "Using the User Port" in <em>COMPUTE!'s First Book of
    Commodore 64</em>. VIC users might also be interested in two articles
    which show how to use the user port to provide a second joystick port:
    "Fighter Aces - Add A Second Joystick" (<em>COMPUTE!'s Second Book of
    VIC</em>) and "Tankmania: Adding A Second Joystick To The VIC"
    (COMPUTE!'s GAZETTE, April 1984).

<h2>The Control Ports</h2>

<p> These ports (or port, in the case of the VIC, which has only one) are
    usually referred to as the joystick ports, since they are most commonly
    used for joysticks. In fact, on the Plus/4 and 16, these ports are
    labeled JOY1 and JOY2. The operating system ROM does not support any
    devices through these ports, so BASIC must communicate using PEEKs and
    POKEs.

<p> In addition to joysticks, which are simple devices consisting of five
    switches - one for each of the four principal directions, plus one for
    the fire button - the ports can be used to read other devices that
    behave like joysticks, such as trackballs. Although the computer
    normally uses the five joystick lines strictly for input, it's possible
    to program them for output as well. We've never seen any peripherals
    for Commodore computers that attempt to output through this port, but
    there are printer interfaces for the Atari which use Atari's nearly
    identical joystick port. (Atari and Coleco joysticks are functionally
    identical to Commodore joysticks for the VIC and 64, and can be used
    interchangeably.)

<p> A warning to those contemplating the purchase of a Plus/4 or Commodore
    16: On those computers Commodore has abandoned the widely used DB-9
    joystick connector in favor of a nonstandard connector, so existing
    joysticks cannot be used. Apparently, this was done to reduce radio
    frequency (RF) interference. The joystick mechanism is exactly the
    same, it's just the plug on the end of the cable that's been changed.
    And the new plug isn't one you'll be able to find easily, so - until
    someone comes out with an adapter plug - you'll be limited to buying
    only Commodore's joysticks. On the other hand, the improved BASIC in
    the Plus/4 and 16 includes a JOY function to read the joysticks, so the
    complicated PEEKs required to read joysticks on the VIC and 64 can be
    avoided.

<p> In addition to the joystick, this port in the VIC and 64 can be used to
    read paddle controllers. (The Plus/4 and 16 have no circuitry for
    reading paddles.) Paddle controllers, which always come in pairs, are
    actually just variable resistors which provide variable voltage levels
    to two lines on the port, Circuitry within the computers (in the VIC
    chip in the VIC-20, and in the SID chip in the 64) calculates a digital
    value corresponding to the voltage level. The value ranges from 0 to
    255 as the voltage on the lines changes from 0 to 5 volts. Other
    devices which operate like paddles - providing a varying voltage input
    - can also be read through this port; graphics tablets are a good
    example.

<p> Each paddle usually also has a button, but instead of being read like
    the joystick buttons, the paddle buttons are connected to the lines for
    two of the joystick directional switches. One paddle button corresponds
    to the joystick's right directional line, and the other to the line for
    reading joystick left. By convention, the paddle that uses the right
    directional line for its button is called the right paddle, and the one
    that uses the joystick-left line is the left paddle.

<p> Unlike Atari joysticks, Atari paddles are not completely
    interchangeable with those made by Commodore. While Atari paddles can
    be used with the VIC and 64, they have a higher resistance and thus are
    less accurate for Commodore systems. (A half turn on Atari paddles
    corresponds roughly to a full turn on Commodore paddles.)

<p> One additional type of peripheral - the light pen - can also be
    connected to this port. The pen contains a phototransistor that
    switches when it detects the electron beam of the video display
    sweeping past. A line is connected from the phototransistor through the
    port to the chip that generates the video signal (the VIC chip in the
    VIC, the VIC-II chip in the 64, and the TED chip in the Plus/4 and 16).

<p> When the video chip receives the signal from the pen, it latches
    (stores) the current position of the raster (electron beam) in a set of
    registers (memory locations within the chip). The stored value can then
    be read, and the position where the pen is touching the screen can be
    calculated. (As with joysticks, Plus/4 and 16 owners will have to wait
    until someone manufactures a light pen with the proper plug to fit the
    unique socket used for this port by those computers.)

<h2>The Audio/Video Port</h2>

<p> This connector is not really a port, since data cannot be transferred
    through it. Instead, it provides a connection point to the computer's
    video and audio signals. With the exception of an audio input line on
    the 64, all lines at this port are outputs only. Like the serial port,
    this port is compatible on the VIC, 64, Plus/4, and 16, but compatible
    doesn't mean identical. When attaching the computer to a video monitor,
    you need a cable that brings out two signals which are available at the
    same pins on all four models, a composite video signal and an audio
    signal. Corresponding video and audio inputs are found on most black
    and white or color monitors. The Commodore 1701/1702 color monitor also
    provides for the input of a luminance signal via the rear connections.
    Separating the luminance provides increased contrast, and drastically
    reduces color smearing.

<p> Television users can attach a thin wire between the composite and
    luminance signals on the video port to improve television contrast, but
    some TVs can't take the extra luminance and produce a distorted screen.
    The more recent 64s use an eight-pin jack rather than the five pins
    used on the VIC and 64, but a five-pin monitor plug will still work.
    The eight-pin 64s have a purer color signal available for use with the
    rear connections of the 1701/1702, so you may want to use an eight-pin
    cable. The 64's audio input line attaches directly to the audio input
    on the SID chip. Be careful to feed in only low-level (unamplified)
    sound sources. There's no way to process the sound, but it can be mixed
    with the sound of the SID chip, and the SID chip's filters can be used
    as a programmable equalizer for the sound coming in.

<h2>The Cassette Port</h2>

<p> This port is designed for one particular peripheral, the Commodore
    Datassette recorder. There are now two models of the Datassette, the
    1530 (or equivalent C2N) for use with the VIC and 64, and the 1531, for
    use with the Plus/4 and 16. As with joysticks, the only difference
    between the two is the plug on the end of the connecting cable.
    Commodore has used a new and incompatible type of connector for this
    port on its new models.

<p> Three of the six lines from this port are used for writing a signal to
    the tape, reading a signal from the tape, and testing whether a button
    is pushed. Note that since there is only one line (labeled Cassette
    Sense) to test the buttons, it's only possible to check whether any
    buttons are pressed, not which particular button or buttons are
    pressed. Thus, if you're supposed to press PLAY and RECORD and
    accidentally press only PLAY, the computer won't be able to detect the
    mistake. Other lines supply power to the tape motor (9 volts) and for
    the electronics in the Datassette (5 volts). Some other peripherals
    for example, several brands of printer interfaces - also make use of
    the 5 volt power source available here.

<p> Communication through this port is
    fully supported by the operating system, with the Datassette being
    designated as device 1. Device 1 is the default storage device; unless
    you specify otherwise, all your SAVEs and LOADs will be directed to
    the Datassette. In addition to SAVE, VERIFY, and LOAD, the OPEN, CLOSE,
    PRINT#, and INPUT# statements provide all the features necessary for
    storing and retrieving data on tape, so programmers rarely need to
    worry about the intimate details of interfacing to this port, such as
    what sort of magnetic pattern is actually used to represent a byte of
    data on tape. Nevertheless, it's possible to program several of the
    individual lines of this port to achieve special effects; for an
    example, refer to the "TurboTape" articles in the January and February
    issues of COMPUTE!, the GAZETTE's sister magazine.
