<h1><u><small>THE PERIPHERAL CONNECTION</small></u><br>
    ENHANCING YOUR 64</h1>
    Selby Bateman, Features Editor
</center>

<p><strong>Peripherals can bring much more power and flexibility to your
    Commodore 64. And they're available as never before. That translates
    into a multitude of opportunities  and changes as you continue to
    enhance your computer's capabilities. Here's an overview of the
    expanding peripheral marketplace for the 64.</strong>

<p> Once you've made the choice to purchase a Commodore 64 computer, your
    decisions begin to multiply. If you thought choosing a microcomputer to
    suit your needs was challenging, you'll soon find yourself overwhelmed
    by the peripheral options open to you. Even experienced computer owners
    discover it's hard to stay abreast of the rapidly growing inventory of
    peripherals designed for the 64.

<p> But this proliferation of products means that some people are making
    mistakes, says Tom Dow, product manager for Commodore's Computer
    Systems Division, "It's obvious - but a very important consideration
    for people who are buying 64s or any computer - that they get involved
    with applications that are really going to benefit them. It's important
    for people to understand what they need to du and get themselves
    plugged into a product that is best going to suit those needs." And
    that means <em>before</em> you make peripheral purchases which may be
    two or even three times the cost of the 64 itself.

<p> Many people buy peripherals without first fully understanding what they
    are going to do with them, how they interact with the Commodore 64, and
    what software is to be used, adds Dow.

<p> If you follow the general rule that a <em>peripheral</em> is any piece
    of hardware which can be plugged into your computer to enhance its
    function, the list of such products includes literally hundreds of
    items from scores of manufacturers. The good news is that there's
    plenty of information at hand for the discerning consumer. And the
    peripheral options really aren't difficult to categorize and compare if
    you'll take the time to think through your choices and your needs.

<p> There are basically five major categories of
    peripherals for nicest microcomputers, including the 64. When you begin
    to think about building a <em>system</em> around your computer, your choices
    include the following:

<ol>
<li><em>Mass storage devices</em> - An absolute necessity for your computer
    since it is this attachment which lets you store information (on tape
    or disk) for later use and also allows you to run commercial software
    not on cartridge. For the 64, the choices have grown rapidly during the
    past year.

<li><em>Display devices</em> - Essentially the television set or video
    monitor which lets you see what you and the computer are doing
    together. There are surprising indications here that 64 owners are
    changing their preferences about what display they wish to use (more on
    this later).

<li><em>Printers</em> - Although printers could be listed as an alternative
    display device, their importance and special functions require a
    separate category. Commodore 64 owners have more choices here than ever
    before, generally at lower prices for better quality.

<li><em>Communication devices</em> - Modems (and telecommunications software) are
    now among the hottest items for Commodore 64 owners. The popularity of
    bulletin boards and the growth of major telecommunications services are
    changing the face of personal computing.

<li><em>Input devices</em> - There are
    many ways other than your computer keyboard for you to interact with
    the 64. Joysticks, light pens, touch tablets, and track balls are just
    a few. And soon even the popular table-top controller called a mouse
    should be available for the 64
</ol>

<p> Let's take a look at some of the changes affecting these peripheral
    product lines for the Commodore 64.

<p> Commodore officials were pleasantly surprised during l984 by a
    significant change in the buying patterns of 64 owners looking for
    storage devices. Over 90 percent of these purchases from Commodore were
    1541 disk drives rather than the more inexpensive Datassette recorders.

<p> "That was one of the things that really threw us for a loop," says
    Commodore's Dow. "The percentage of people who actually bought disk
    drives to go with the 64 was very <em>high</em>." Commodore was caught
    by surprise and there was a period about a year ago when 1541s were in
    very short supply.

<p> Since there are some other sources for inexpensive cassette tape drives
    compatible with the 64, it would be wrong to presume that the 90
    percent figure would apply throughout the Commodore 64 marketplace.
    However, the combination of low price (about $250 for the 1541), the
    relatively faster access times of a disk drive over tape, and the trend
    toward putting more and more commercial software on disk rather than
    cassette has dramatically altered the situation.

<p> "For the majority of the people who purchase the 64, the first buy will
    be the disk drive," says Dow. "When the 64 first came out, there was a
    lot of software on cartridge since there was skepticism about how many
    people would purchase the disk drive." That is true no longer.

<p> As any Commodore 64 owner quickly learns, the computer accesses data
    from a cassette tape drive in a sequential manner. The tape slides by
    the read/record head in a linear fashion. You can't get to the third
    program on a tape without winding past the first two programs. The disk
    drive, however, is a random access device. The read/write head can jump
    from spot to spot on a disk much as a record player needle can be
    placed anywhere on the surface of a record. Such accessibility and
    speed have proven too attractive for most 64 owners to ignore.
    
<p> Although the first purchase for 64 owners may be a disk drive, that
    doesn't necessarily mean it will be the 1541. As the installed base of
    Commodore 64s has increased, the peripheral marketplace has become
    crowded with competitors. And that includes disk drive manufacturers.

<p>

<table>

        <td valign="bottom"><img src="Indus.gif" alt="[The Indus GT disk drive]"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>The MSD Super Disk Drives</td>
        <td>The Indus GT disk drive</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

    For example, MSD Systems, Inc., has developed single and dual Super
    Disk Drives for the Commodore 64 aimed at being faster, cooler running,
    and more dependable than the 1541. "It was clear to us that if we were
    to compete in Commodore's market, we would have to produce products of
    superior quality," states Jim Gragg, MSD vice president of engineering.

<p> MSD's dual drive, the Super Disk II, is more expensive than two single
    Commodore drives - about $695 - but will reportedly format, copy, and
    verify in less than two minutes what two 1541s would need 35 to 40
    minutes to complete. The single-drive Super Disk I is priced at $399.

<p> Other disk drives now available for the 64 are the $399 Indus GT from
    Indus Systems, which is reportedly 400 percent faster than the 1541,
    and the $369 Commander II from Commander Electronic Systems. Here
    again, as with the MSD drives, there are price/performance tradeoffs
    in relation to Commodore's 1541 drive.

<p> While the competition heats up between 64 disk drive manufacturers,
    there is a clear move away from the slower sequential access tape
    drives which so dominated during the early days of the VIC-20 and 64.
    As the market matures, so do the tastes and demands of 64 owners.

<p> For those who wish to use a cassette
    drive, Electronic Components of Elma, New York, has engineered a way
    for you to save even more money. Rather than buying a Commodore
    Datassette recorder, the company offers the Computer Patch Cord
    (CPC-1000), a $29.95 cord which lets you use a 64 or VIC-20 with an
    ordinary cassette recorder.

<p> Another surprise for officials at Commodore
    last year was the popularity among 64 owners of the 1702 color video
    monitor, It became, on average,
    the next most-purchased Commodore peripheral after storage devices.
    "Again, we were relatively shocked with the percentage of people who
    wi11 buy the 1702," says Dow. "It boils down to a number of different
    reasons. Obviously, resolution is much better on the 1702 than it would
    be on a television set. The second thing we've found - although we
    give the proper hookup requirements to attach a 64 to a television set
    a lot of people don't like to tie up their TV set with the computer. So
    by buying the 1702 monitor, it gives them the ability to have a
    dedicated work station without interrupting a television set."

<p> Just as inexpensive tape drives bring you functionality at a low price,
    so your television set can bring you a computer's video images without
    additional expense. All you need to do is attach the RF modulator to
    your black and white or color TV, and you're in business.

<p> Commodore 64 owners are turning toward disk
    drives for much the same reason they're now using dedicated video
    monitors in increasing numbers: greater performance for more serious
    applications. Especially with the rising interest in productivity
    programs such as word processors, data bases, and
    spreadsheets, owners of the 64 are more often asking for the greater
    clarity of a video monitor. Even on the best color television sets, an
    80-column line of printed characters (now available in several word
    processor and spreadsheet formats for the 64) is all but unreadable.
    Not so with the variety of video monitors on the market from companies
    like Cardco, Commodore, Roland DG, Samsung, Teknika, Amdek, Sakata, and
    others.

<p> Some Commodore 64 owners are opting for both color television
    and the high-quality of direct video monitors. Cardco's $199.95 MT/1
    Monitor Tuner, for example, is a remote-controlled, 60-channel,
    cable-ready tuner which provides separate video and audio output matched
    to composite input computer monitors. It works with any color or
    monochrome monitor, transforming it into a television set with the flip
    of a switch.

<p> While the choice between monitors and television sets is usually an
    easy one, no peripheral for your Commodore 64 is likely to be trickier
    to choose than a printer. The many different companies, the various
    types available (dot matrix, daisy wheel, thermal, thermal transfer,
    ink jet, etc.), and the continuing price cuts by manufacturers make
    this an exciting but potentially frustrating decision for the 64 owner.
    We'll discuss the ins and outs of buying and using a printer in an
    upcoming issue, but for now a few warnings should help you in your
    search.

<p> <em>Compatibility</em> is the watchword here. Ignore it and you may
    wind up taking home a printer which at best doesn't fully use the power
    of the 64 and at worst is almost worthless. The built-in graphics
    characters which are directly accessible from the 64 keyboard, for
    example, can't be reproduced by some printers, at least without the
    addition of a ROM chip or some other modification. Before you begin to
    look for a printer, decide on what your uses are likely to be. That
    will make the tradeoffs on price, performance, compatibility, and other
    factors much easier to assess.

<p> If you want to print program listings, an inexpensive printer will suit
    your needs. For letters or business applications, you'll need a printer
    that handles standard paper (single sheets or formfeed) and offers
    correspondence-quality characters. And make sure the software you own
    will work with the printer you choose.

<p> Commodore currently offers three dot-matrix printers for the 64, the
    MPS-801, the MPS-802 (an enhanced version of Commodore's 1526 printer),
    and the new MPS-803. "Someone who is doing more in the business or
    productivity end of applications normally will buy the MPS802," says
    Dow. "We're seeing the MPS-803 being bought by individuals interested
    in the educational and recreational aspects of the product itself -
    more of an all-purpose printer because it does standard text printing,
    but also has the capability to do dot-addressable graphics."

<p> As the 64 became the clear leader among home computers in 1984, printer
    manufacturers raced to provide the best print quality at the lowest
    price for 64 owners. That is continuing, making your purchase of a
    printer a potentially formidable task. Companies such as Alphacom, Blue
    Chip Electronics, Cardco, C. Itoh, Epson, Ergo Systems, Leading Edge,
    Okidata, Star Micronics, and many others provide printers which you'll
    want to compare before deciding.


<center>
    <img src="Riteman.gif" alt="[The new $349 Riteman C+ printer has a built-in Commodore interface.]">
</center>

<p> Joining the list are two new dot-matrix printers from Riteman: the R 64
    and the Riteman C+. Both include a built-in Commodore interface and
    offer Commodore graphics characters.

<p> The R 64 has both parallel and serial capacity, so it can be used with
    other computers as well as the 64. It prints at 120 cps and employs bit
    image graphics. It sells for $449. The Riteman C+, priced at $349,
    prints at 105 cps.

<p> Perhaps the fastest growing area of home computing is
    telecommunications - the sending and receiving of data between
    computers.

<p> "This is really becoming a very hot item, not just for Commodore, but
    for the industry in general," says Commodore's Dow. "And I think we're
    going to find more demand for modems as we find more and more people
    offering different types of services. Modem sales for us have been
    strong, and it's going to get stronger as time goes on."

<p> The modem is simply a device which modulates digital data from your
    computer into analog sound transmissions carried by the telephone
    lines, and then demodulates those same type of analog signals when your
    64 receives data from another computer via the phone. There are two
    types of modems. An acoustic modem has rubber cups into which your
    telephone's handset fits and sends signals acoustically through the
    telephone; a direct-connect modem plugs directly into the phone lines,
    as its name implies. Acoustic modems are older and less reliable, and
    are therefore being superseded by the newer direct-connect devices.

<table align="right">
    <tr><td><img src="1660.gif" alt="[Commodore's new 1660 Automodem.]"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Commodore's new 1660 Automodem.</td></tr>
</table>

<p> You should be aware that the 64's RS-232 (a Recommended Standard, hence
    RS) serial port - through which your modem will communicate - is not
    compatible with the industry-accepted RS-232 port. Make sure that the
    modem you buy is compatible with the 64, or you'll have to buy an
    adapter to make it work.

<p> Commodore now offers three different modems, each of which connects
    directly into the 64's user port, but offers different capabilities.
    The 1600 VICModem (about $50 - $70) and the 1650 AutoModem (about $79 -
    $100) have been joined by the 1660 AutoModem (about $100). The latter
    two allow your computer to automatically redial numbers when necessary
    and to automatically answer incoming calls from other computers. In
    addition, the 1660 has a speaker built into it so that you can monitor
    the audio status of the modem. It works with the Plus/4 as well as the
    64 and VIC-20, notes Dow.

<p> In addition to the Commodore modems, there are a variety of
    64-compatible modems that have become available from other
    manufacturers. Human Engineered Software (HES) manufactures two
    HESmodems, one priced at $74.95 and the other at $109.95. Anchor
    Automation now offers the $99 Westridge 64-20 modem, Taroco is selling
    the $99.95 Mitey Mo, and other modems by Intec Corporation, MFJ
    Enterprises, Inc., and The Microperipheral Corp., are all compatible
    with your 64 without the need for an interface. (See "A Buyer's Guide
    To Modems" in the November 1984 GAZETTE for more detailed information.)

<p> The expanding base of peripherals for the 64 includes a variety of
    input devices. As more and more people have been brought into the world
    of computing, an increasing percentage are unaccustomed to typing, and
    hence, keyboards. Children especially can find the array of 67
    different keys on the Commodore 64 a daunting and frustrating means by
    which to learn about computers.

<p> To combat this problem, a number of companies have come out with
    products aimed at easing a child's first exposure to computers.
    Simplified plastic keyboard overlays are now being used in many early
    learning programs, such as in CBS Software's Sesame Street series.
    Koala Technologies released the Muppet Learning Keys in 1984, a plug-in
    pad which features easy-to-use letters, numbers, colors, and other
    functions.

<p> "Alternative input devices are becoming more and more
    important as time goes on in just about every segment of the
    marketplace, particularly the home," says Dow. "We're working on a
    variety of different forms of input devices."

<p> At last year's Consumer Electronics Shows, for instance, Commodore
    displayed its Touch Screen, a plastic overlay which fits over the front
    of a monitor or television set. By touching the screen with your finger
    or a pointer you gain access to menus and other controls in a variety
    of programs. Although not yet released, the Touch Screen - in some form
    - is expected to be available soon, perhaps by the time you read is,
    notes Dow.

<p> Even novice computer users are at least somewhat familiar the
    joysticks, game paddles, touch tablets, keypads, and light pens which are
    the most familiar alternative input devices. Making decisions about these
    peripherals is usually not difficult as is the case with printers,
    modems, or storage devices. But, as with all peripherals, what you plan
    to do with them can make the difference between wasted money and a
    genuinely useful addition your 64 system.

<p> Among the newer input devices are music keyboards which, with
    accompanying software, make use of the Commodore 64's Sound Interface
    Device (SID) chip. Companies like Passport, Sight & Sound, Tech Sketch,
    Sequential Circuits, Waveform, and others are selling a variety of
    these keyboards, with prices generally round $200 or less. (See
    'Commodore 64 Music For Non-Musicians" in the February GAZETTE.)

<p> Over the past year or so, the <em>mouse</em> - a rolling desk-top device which controls the screen cursor
    and other onscreen functions - has become a very popular alternative input device for
    Apple, IBM, and some other computers. While Commodore reportedly has no
    plans to develop a mouse, a number of other companies are rumored to
    plan to produce them for the 64.

<p> Beyond the five major peripheral categories mentioned here, there are
    still many more products which can make substantial differences in what
    you can do with your 64. Memory expansion devices, surge suppressors,

<table align="right" width="412">

    <tr><td>Navarone's $39.95 three-slot catridge expander for the 64 lets you plug in up to three cartridges that are switch selectable.</td></tr>
</table>

    reset switches, and cartridge slot expanders are among the peripherals
    you'll want to learn more about. Even an Apple II+ computer emulator
    for the 64 (from a Canadian company, Mimic Systems) should be available
    shortly. The complete package, called The Spartan, is expected to
    retail for just under $600 and allow your 64 to use standard Apple II+
    hardware and software, according to a company official.

<p> The U.S. home and office personal computer peripherals market will
    probably reach $26.4 billion in retail value by 1989, according to
    figures compiled by Future Computing, Inc., a respected computer market
    research firm. That's a $17.3 billion increase over the 1984 figure.
    The choices will continue to increase as manufacturers take advantage
    of the huge installed base of Commodore 64s.

<p> With proper planning and a clear understanding of your needs, choosing
    peripherals can be another interesting aspect of computing rather than
    an expensive exercise in frustration.
