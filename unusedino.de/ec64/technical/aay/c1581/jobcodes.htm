  If a disk controller routine is to be performed in the interrupt, one
  writes the job code and the track and sector numbers of the block to be
  processed (if necessary) in the appropriate memory locations. Now the
  job code can be passed. This job code has a value greater than 127 (the
  7th bit is set). In order to wait until the job is finished, only the
  seventh bit need be tested. If this bit is cleared, the job is completed.
  The disk controller can perform the following jobs:

  +--------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------+
  |  Code  |     Name     |  Description                                  |
  +--------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------+
  |  $80   | READ_DV      |  Reads  a particular logical sector into the  |
  |        |              |  job queue buffer  (only if the disk has not  |
  |        |              |  been  changed).  If  the  desired sector is  |
  |        |              |  already in the track cache buffer,  then no  |
  |        |              |  disk  activity  is  required  (the  data is  |
  |        |              |  merely  transferred  from  the  track cache  |
  |        |              |  memory to the job queue buffer memory).  If  |
  |        |              |  the  desired  sector  is  not  in the track  |
  |        |              |  cache,  then  the  current  track  cache is  |
  |        |              |  dumped  to  disk   (only  if  it  has  been  |
  |        |              |  modified),  the  desired track is read into  |
  |        |              |  the track cache, and finally the particular  |
  |        |              |  sector's data is transferred from the track  |
  |        |              |  cache memory to the job queue buffer.        |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $82   | RESET_DV     |  Resets  the  disk controller and associated  |
  |        |              |  variables.                                   |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $84   | MOTON_DV     |  Turns on the spindle motor  (overlays a $01  |
  |        |              |  in the Job Queue after the spin-up sequence  |
  |        |              |  is complete).                                |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $86   | MOTOFF_DV    |  Turns the spindle motor off after the spin-  |
  |        |              |  down sequence is complete.                   |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $88   | MOTONI_DV    |  Turns the spindle motor on immediately.      |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $8A   | MOTOFFI_DV   |  Turns the spindle motor off immediately.     |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $8C   | SEEK_DV      |  Seeks  to  a  particular   physical   track  |
  |        |              |  (cylinder).   The  current  physical  track  |
  |        |              |  position   should   be  put  in  the  track  |
  |        |              |  parameter of HDRS.                           |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $8E   | FORMAT_DV    |  Formats  one  physical track (one half of a  |
  |        |              |  cylinder).   The   head   must   be  placed  |
  |        |              |  physically  over  the  proper cylinder, and  |
  |        |              |  the  head  electronics must be selected for  |
  |        |              |  the side desired.                            |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $90   | WRTSD_DV     |  Writes  the  job  queue's  buffer data to a  |
  |        |              |  particular  logical track,  sector.  If the  |
  |        |              |  same  track  is already in the track cache,  |
  |        |              |  then  this  involves  only transferring the  |
  |        |              |  job  queue  buffer  data to the track cache  |
  |        |              |  buffer.  If  a different track's data is in  |
  |        |              |  the  disk  (only  if  it was modified), the  |
  |        |              |  desired  track  read  into  the track cache  |
  |        |              |  buffer,  and finally the job queue buffer's  |
  |        |              |  data transferred to the track cache.         |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $92   | DISKIN_DV    |  Determines  if  there is a disk inserted in  |
  |        |              |  the drive.                                   |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $94   | LEDACTON_DV  |  Turns on the activity LED.                   |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $96   | LEDACTOFF_DV |  Turns off the activity LED.                  |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $98   | ERRLEDON_DV  |  Enables error LED blinking.                  |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $9A   | ERRLEDOFF_DV |  Disables error LED blinking.                 |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $9C   | SIDE_DV      |  Sets  up the side select electronics to the  |
  |        |              |  value specified (in SIDS).                   |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $9E   | BUFMOVE_DV   |  Moves data between the job queue buffer and  |
  |        |              |  the track cache buffer. The track parameter  |
  |        |              |  in  the  job  queue denotes the position in  |
  |        |              |  the track cache buffer to transfer to/from.  |
  |        |              |  The sector parameter denotes the following:  |
  |        |              |    Bit 7 :  Direction  (1 = to  track  cache  |
  |        |              |             buffer)                           |
  |        |              |    Bit 6 :  Mark Flag  (set/clear the 'track  |
  |        |              |             cache modified' flag)             |
  |        |              |    Bit 5 :  Transfer (1 = do the transfer)    |
  |        |              |    Bits 4-0:# of 256 byte blocks to transfer  |
  |        |              |  With bit 7 set,  the corresponding physical  |
  |        |              |  track  position  in  the  job queue (HDRS2)  |
  |        |              |  must  be updated for the purpose of telling  |
  |        |              |  the  controller  what  physical  track  the  |
  |        |              |  track cache buffer belongs to.  In addition  |
  |        |              |  the side var (SIDS) must also be updated.    |
  |        |              |                                               |
  |  $A0   | WRTVER_DV    |  Verifies  the  track  cache  buffer's  data  |

  |  $A2   | TRKWRT_DV    |  Dumps  the  track  cache buffer to the disk  |
  |        |              |  (only  if  the track cache modified flag is  |
  |        |              |  set).                                        |
  |        |              |                                               |

  |        |              |  It does not use the track cache buffer. The  |

  |        |              |  directly.  It does not use the track cache.  |
  |        |              |  Data  to  be  written  starts  at buffer #0  |
  |        |              |  ($0300).                                     |
