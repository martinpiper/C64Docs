Welcome to Project 64!

The goal of Project 64 is to preserve Commodore 64 related documents
in electronic text format that might otherwise cease to exist with the
rapid advancement of computer technology and declining interest in 8-
bit computers on the part of the general population.

Extensive efforts were made to preserve the contents of the original
document.  However, certain portions, such as diagrams, program
listings, and indexes may have been either altered or sacrificed due
to the limitations of plain vanilla text.  Diagrams may have been
eliminated where ASCII-art was not feasible.  Program listings may be
missing display codes where substitutions were not possible.  Tables
of contents and indexes may have been changed from page number
references to section number references. Please accept our apologies
for these limitations, alterations, and possible omissions.

Document names are limited to the 8.3 file convention of DOS. The
first characters of the file name are an abbreviation of the original
document name. The version number of the etext follows next. After
that a letter may appear to indicate the particular source of the
document. Finally, the document is given a .TXT extension.

The author(s) of the original document and members of Project 64 make
no representations about the accuracy or suitability of this material
for any purpose.  This etext is provided &quot;as-is&quot;.  Please refer to the
warantee of the original document, if any, that may included in this
etext.  No other warantees, express or implied, are made to you as to
the etext or any medium it may be on.  Neither the author(s) nor the
members of Project 64 will assume liability for damages either from
the direct or indirect use of this etext or from the distribution of
or modification to this etext. Therefore if you read this document or
use the information herein you do so at your own risk.

INTRODUCTION

  Your  new  COMMODORE 64  is the best home computer available today. You
can  use  your  COMMODORE 64 for everything from business applications to
household  paperwork to exciting games.  The 64 offers you lots of memory
(64K),  lots  of color  (16 different colors),  lots of sound  (music and
sound  effects),  and  lots  of  fun  and  practical  uses.  You  can use
prepackaged software, or you can write your own programs in easy-to-learn
BASIC.

  This easy-to-read user's guide contains all the information you need to
set  up  your  equipment  properly,  understand  how  to operate your new
COMMODORE 64, and learn how to create your own simple BASIC programs.
  This user's guide is intended to introduce you to computers,  but it is
beyond  the  scope of this manual to tell you everything you need to know
about computers or about BASIC.  However,  this guide does refer you to a
variety  of  publications that explain the topics we present here in more
detail.
  For those of you who don't want to learn how to program, you won't have
to  search  through  the  whole  book  to  learn  how  to  use  Commodore
prepackaged  programs  and  games,  or  other  prepackaged,  third  party
software.  We've  put all the information you need to know right up front
in Chapters 1 and 2.

  Many  exciting  features  are waiting for you inside your COMMODORE 64.
Your  new  computer  gives you the microcomputer industry's most advanced
graphics, which we call SPRITE GRAPHICS. Sprite graphics let you:

  o Design your own pictures in different colors, just like the ones you
    see on arcade-type video games.
  o Animate as many as 8 different picture levels at a time.
  o Move your creations anywhere on the screen.
  o Double their size.
  o Pass images in front or behind each other.
  o Use automatic collision detection that tells the computer to do
    whatever you want when sprites hit each other.

These features let you design your own games.
  The  COMMODORE 64  also has built-in music and sound effects that rival
many well known music synthesizers. This part of your computer gives you:

  o 3 independent voices, each with a full 9 octave piano-type range.
  o 4 different waveforms (sawtooth, triangle, variable pulse and noise).
  o A programmable ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, and release) envelope
    generator.
  o A programmable high, low, and bandpass filter that you can use for
    each voice.
  o Variable resonance and volume controls.

  If   you   want  your  music  to  play  back  with  professional  sound
reproduction,  the  COMMODORE  64  lets  you connect your audio output to
almost any high-quality amplification system.

  As your computing needs grow, so can your system. You can expand your
system by connecting your COMMODORE 64 to other pieces of equipment,
known as peripherals. These accessories include items like these:

  o The DATASSETTE* recorder, for tapes.
  o The VIC 1541 disk drive (as many as five at a time).
  o The COMMODORE dot matrix printers, for hard copies of your programs,
    letters, etc.
  o The MODEM cartridge, for access through your telephone to the massive
    data bases of larger computers, as well as the services of hundreds
    of specialists and a variety of information networks.
  o The Commodore 1701 color monitor.

If you already have a VIC 1540 disk drive, your dealer can upgrade it for
use with the COMMODORE 64.
  Commodore  wants  you  to  really  enjoy your new COMMODORE 64.  And to
have fun,  bear in mind that programming takes time to learn.  Be patient
with yourself as you go through the USER'S GUIDE.  But, before you start,
please  take a few minutes to fill out and mail in the owner/registration
card  that came with your computer.  This will ensure that your COMMODORE
64  is  properly  registered  with  Commodore  Headquarters  and that you
receive the most up-to-date information regarding future enhancements for
your machine.

NOTE:  Many  programs  are  under  development while this manual is being
produced.  Please  check  with  your  local  Commodore  dealer  and  with
Commodore User's Magazines  and Clubs,  which will keep you up to date on
the  wealth  of applications programs being written for the COMMODORE 64,
worldwide.

1.3. OPTIONAL CONNECTIONS

  Since  the 64 furnishes a channel of high fidelity sound,  you may wish
to  play  it  through  a  quality  amplifier  to  realize  the best sound
possible.  In  addition,  the 64 also provides a standard composite video
signal, that can be fed into a television monitor.
  These  options  are made possible by the audio/video output jack on the
rear panel of the 64.  The easiest way to gain access to these signals is
by  using  a  standard  5-Pin DIN audio cable (not supplied).  This cable
connects  directly  to the audio/video connector on the computer.  Two of
the  four  pins  on  the  opposite end of the cable contain the audio and
video signals.  You can construct your own cable, using the pinouts shown
in Appendix I as a guide.
  Normally,  the  BLACK  connector  of  the  DIN cable supplies the AUDIO
signal.  This  plug  may  be  connected  to  the  AUXILIARY  input  of an
amplifier,  or the AUDIO IN connector of a monitor or other video system,
such as a video cassette recorder (VCR).
  The  WHITE  or  RED connector usually supplies the direct VIDEO signal.
This  plug is connected to the VIDEO IN connector of the monitor or video
input section of some other video system, such as a VCR.
  Depending  on  the manufacturer of your DIN cable,  the color coding of
the plugs may be different.  Use the pinouts shown in Appendix I to match
up the proper plugs  if you don't get an audio or video signal  using the
suggested connections.

1.4. OPERATION

USING THE 64

1. Turn  on  the computer using the rocker switch on the right-side panel
   when you're looking at the computer from the front.
2. After a few moments the following will be displayed on the TV screen:

      **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****
   64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE

   READY.
   _  &lt;----------- CURSOR SIGNALS COMMODORE 64 IS WAITING FOR YOUR INPUT

3. If your TV has a manual fine tuning knob,  adjust the TV until you get
   a clear picture.
4. You  may also want to adjust the color and tint controls on the TV for
   the best display. You can use the color adjustment procedure described
   later to get everything set up properly. When you first get a picture,
   the  screen  should appear mostly dark blue,  with a light blue border
   and letters.

  If  you  don't  get  the  expected  results,  recheck  the  cables  and
connections. The accompanying chart will help you isolate any problem.

| TIP: The 64 was designed to be used by everyone.                      |
| But we at Commodore recognize that computer users may,  occasionally, |
| run into difficulties.  To  help  answer  your questions and give you |
| some   fun   programming   ideas,   Commodore   has  created  several |
| publications  to help you.  You might also find that it's a good idea |
| to join a  Commodore Users Club to help you meet some other 64 owners |
| who can help you gain knowledge and experience.                       |

CURSOR

  The  flashing  square  under READY is called the cursor.  It's a marker
that  shows  where what you type on the keyboard will be displayed on the
screen.  As  you  type,  the cursor moves ahead one space as the original
cursor  position is replaced with the character you typed.  Try typing on
the  keyboard  and  watch  the  cursor move while characters you type are
displayed on the screen.


1.6. COLOR ADJUSTMENT

  There  is a simple way to get a pattern of colors on the monitor so you
can  easily adjust the set.  Even though you may not be familiar with the
operation  of the computer right now,  just follow along,  and you'll see
how easy it is to use your computer.
  First,  look on the left side of the keyboard and locate the key marked
&lt;CTRL&gt;.  This  stands for ConTRoL and is used,  in conjunction with other
keys, to instruct the computer to do a specific task.
  To  use  a  control  function,  you  hold  down  the  &lt;CTRL&gt;  key while
pressing a second key.
  Try this:  hold the  &lt;CTRL&gt;  key while also pressing the &lt;9&gt; key.  Then
release both keys. Nothing obvious should have happened, but if you touch
any  key  now,  the  screen  will show the character displayed in reverse
type, rather than normal type -- like the opening message or anything you
typed earlier.
  Hold down the &lt;SPACE BAR&gt;. What happens? If you did the above procedure
correctly,  you  should  see  a light blue bar move across the screen and
then move down to the next line as long as the &lt;SPACE BAR&gt; is pressed.

  READY.
  ____________________________
  __________

  Now,  hold &lt;CTRL&gt; while pressing any of the other number keys.  Each of
them has a color marked on the front.  Anything displayed from this point
will be in that color.  For example,  hold  &lt;CTRL&gt;  and the  &lt;8&gt;  key and
release both. Now hold the &lt;SPACE BAR&gt;.
  Watch the display.  The bar is now in yellow!  In a like manner you can
change  the  bar  to  any  of  the colors indicated on the number keys by
holding &lt;CTRL&gt; and the appropriate key.
  Change the bar to a few more different colors and then adjust the color
and  tint  controls on your monitor so the display matches the colors you
selected.
  The display should appear something like this:

  READY.
  _________________________     &lt;------ &lt;3&gt; RED BAR
  _______ ____________ ____     &lt;------ &lt;3&gt;,&lt;6&gt;,&lt;7&gt; RED, GREEN, BLUE BARS
  __________ ______________     &lt;------ &lt;7&gt;,&lt;8&gt; BLUE, YELLOW BARS
  ____________                  &lt;------ &lt;8&gt; YELLOW BAR

  At  this  point  everything is properly adjusted and working correctly.
The following chapters will introduce you to the BASIC language. However,
you can  immediately start using some of the many prewritten applications
and games available without knowing anything about computer programming.
  Each  of  these packages contains detailed information about how to use
the program. It is suggested, though, that you read through the first few
chapters  of  this  manual  to become more familiar with the operation of
your new system.


1.7. EXPANDING YOUR SYSTEM WITH OPTIONAL PERIPHERALS

  Commodore  offers  a  variety  of  peripheral  devices  that expand the
capabilities of your computer. These peripherals include:

  o storage devices
  o printers and plotters
  o monitors
  o modems for telecommunications
  o game attachments
  o speech and graphics modules
  o desktop controllers


STORAGE DEVICES

Disk Drives

  Commodore's  disk  drives let you store large amounts of information on
5-1/4&quot; floppy diskettes.  Diskettes offer fast storage and retrieval, and
they automatically keep track of all your files in a directory,  or table
of contents, that you can display on your screen or print on a printer.
  In  addition,  you  can add extra disk drives by daisy-chaining them to
your computer. Daisy-chaining means connecting one drive to the computer,
and then connecting additional drives to each other.
  By  acquiring  the  Commodore 64 IEEE Interface Expansion Card, you can
also attach any IEEE disk drive,  such as Commodore's  CBM 8050  or  4040
Dual Floppy Disk Drives, to the 64.
  Chapter 2 contains detailed information on using disk drives.


PRINTING AND PLOTTING DEVICES

Printers

  You can attach Commodore printers to the 64.  These are inexpensive dot
matrix  printers.  By acquiring the Commodore 64 IEEE Interface Expansion
Card,  you  can  also  attach any IEEE printer,  such as Commodore's 6400
letter  quality  printer,  or  the  high  speed  8023 dot matrix printer,
to the 64.

Printer/Plotter

  Commodore's  1520  Printer/Plotter  prints  and  draws graphics in four
colors  (black,  blue,  red and green).  With the 1520,  you can draw bar
charts, pies, and a variety of complex graphics.


THE 1701/1702 MONITOR

  Commodore's 14&quot; color monitor offers a superior color picture with high
resolution  that enhances your computing experience.  This monitor can be
connected to the 64. The monitor is connected to the computer by an 8-pin
DIN  cable.  The 1701/1702 Color Monitor User's Guide that comes with the
monitor clearly explains connections. You can also consult Appendix I for
information about the pinouts in the 8-pin connector.


ATTACHMENTS FOR GAMES AND OTHER USES

  Commodore  offers  joysticks  and  paddles that enhance game-playing on
your  computer.  These  attachments  also  have other applications.  Also
available  is  the  Commodore  lightpen which,  with appropriate software
allows communication with the computer on the screen.


COMMODORE GRAPHIC AIDS

  Commodore  provides  a variety of graphics programming aids,  including
SIMON'S  BASIC  which adds 114 powerful new commands to BASIC,  including
programming  help  and  graphics  commands;  and  LOGO,  an easy-to-learn
programming language with TURTLE graphics.


MUSIC ATTACHMENTS

  Commodore  will  also  soon  offer  a  Musical  Keyboard  and  a  3-pad
percussion attachment called  the  Digi-drum.  Both products will include
special  software  packages.  These  attachments  will increase the music
making capabilities of the 64 computers.


CONNECTING TO A STEREO SYSTEM

  The  sound  and  music-making  capabilities  of the COMMODORE 64 can be
enhanced  by  connecting  your  computer  to a high quality amplifier and
stereo  speakers.  The  8-pin  DIN cable discussed in the 1701/1702 Color
Monitor  section  can  also  be  used  to  connect  your  computer  to an
amplifier.


DESIGNING A COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR YOUR NEEDS

  Commodore  offers a variety of peripherals that let you create your own
customized  computer  system.   We  offer  different  types  of  storage,
printing,  and  telecommunications  devices so you can choose what's best
for  you.  For  more  information about  Commodore peripherals,  read The
Commodore  Peripherals  Guide  and  the  Commodore magazines discussed in
Appendix H and consult your Commodore dealer.



2. GETTING STARTED


2.1. COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR 64: THE KEYBOARD

  The  computer  keyboard  lets you communicate with your 64. You use the
keys  to  tell  the  computer  what  you  want it to do and to answer the
questions the computer displays on the screen.
  The  keyboard  looks  like  a  regular typewriter, but the computer has
special  keys  that  let the 64 do more than a typewriter. While you read
the next few pages, take a look at these special keys.

&lt;RETURN&gt;                 The  &lt;RETURN&gt;  key tells the computer to look at
                       what you typed and put this information in memory.
                       The &lt;RETURN&gt; key also moves the cursor to the next
                       line.

                       NOTE:  Memory  is all the information the computer
                       currently  knows  without  needing  you to tell it
                       where to look.

&lt;SHIFT&gt;                  The  &lt;SHIFT&gt;  key  works like the shift key on a
                       regular  typewriter:  it  lets  you  print capital
                       letters  or the top characters on double character
                       keys.

                          ___       ___       ___
                         / ! \     / &quot; \     / # \
                        || 1 ||   || 2 ||   || 3 ||
                        /\___/\   /\___/\   /\___/\
                        |_____|   |_____|   |_____|


                         When  you  are using the graphics on the font of
                       the  keys,  the  &lt;SHIFT&gt;  key displays the graphic
                       character on the RIGHT side of the key.

                          ___       ___       ___
                         /   \     /   \     /   \
                        || Q ||   || W ||   || E ||
                        /\___/\   /\___/\   /\___/\
                        |_|_-_|   |_-_|_|   |_|_-_|


                         When  you  are  using  the four special function
                       keys  at  the  right  side  of  the keyboard,  the
                       &lt;SHIFT&gt;  key  gives you the functions on the FRONT
                       of the key (F2, F4, F6, and F8).

KEYS THAT LET YOU MAKE CHANGES

&lt;CRSR&gt;                   The  cursor is the little colored rectangle that
                       marks  your  place  on  the screen.  There are two
                       CuRSoR keys:

                       &lt;CRSR-UP/DOWN&gt;     moves the cursor up and down
                       &lt;CRSR-LEFT/RIGHT&gt;  moves the cursor left and right

                         You must use the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key with the  &lt;CRSR-UP/
                       DOWN&gt;  key  to  move  the cursor up,  and with the
                       &lt;CRSR-LEFT/RIGHT&gt; key to move the cursor to the
                       left.
                         You don't have to keep tapping a  &lt;CRSR&gt;  key to
                       get it to move more than one space.  Just  hold it
                       down until the cursor is where you want it.

&lt;INTS/DEL&gt;             DEL  stands  for DELete.  When you press the &lt;DEL&gt;
                       key,  the cursor moves back a space and erases the
                       character that's there.

                       PRINT &quot;ERROR&quot;#_
                       PRINT &quot;ERROR&quot;#

                         When  you  DELete in the middle of a line,  move
                       the  cursor  just to the left of the character you
                       want to DELete.

                       FIX IT AGAINS, SAM
                       FIX IT AGAINS_ SAM

                         Then press the &lt;DEL&gt; key.  The characters to the
                       right  automatically  move  over  to  close up the
                       space.

                       FIX IT AGAIN, SAM

                         INST  stands  for  INSerT.  You  have to use the
                       &lt;SHIFT&gt; key with the &lt;INST/DEL&gt; key  when you want
                       to insert characters in a line.
                         If  you've  left  some characters out of a line,
                       use the &lt;CRSR&gt; keys to move the cursor back to the
                       error.

                       WHILE U WERE OUT
                       WHILE _ WERE OUT

                         Then, while you hold down the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key, press
                       the  &lt;INST/DEL&gt; key until you have enough space to
                       add  the  missing characters.  &lt;INST&gt; doesn't move
                       the cursor;  it  adds space between the cursor and
                       the character to its right.

                       WHILE _ U WERE OUT
                       WHILE YOU WERE OUT

                         Use the  &lt;DEL&gt;  and  &lt;INST&gt; keys together to fix
                       wrong characters.

                       WE'RE NUMBER TWO!
                       WE'RE NUMBER !
                       WE'RE NUMBER _  !
                       WE'RE NUMBER ONE!

&lt;CLR/HOME&gt;               HOME  moves  the  cursor  back to the upper left
                       corner  of  the screen.  This is called the &quot;HOME&quot;
                       position.
                         CLR stands for CLeaR.  When you use the  &lt;SHIFT&gt;
                       key with the &lt;CLR/HOME&gt; key, the screen CLeaRs and
                       the cursor returns to the home position.

&lt;RESTORE&gt;                The  RESTORE  key  returns  the  computer to its
                       normal  state by RESTOREing the default conditions
                       (e.g.,  the  default  screen  color  is blue,  the
                       default for I/O chips is OFF, etc.).  RESTORE does
                       such  things as clear the screen,  returning it to
                       the original color,  and turn off the picture- and
                       sound-making chips.

                       NOTE:  For  &lt;RESTORE&gt; to work,  you must hold down
                       the &lt;STOP&gt; key while you press the &lt;RESTORE&gt; key.

                         For example,  suppose you've just played a music
                       program  that  also  turned  your  screen  red and
                       yellow while it LISTed the program. When you press
                       &lt;STOP&gt;  and  &lt;RESTORE&gt;  at the end of the program,
                       the  last  note from the program will cease,  your
                       screen will turn blue and the only thing displayed
                       will be the READY prompt.

FUNCTION KEYS

The keys on the right side of the keyboard, F1-F8, are function keys that
you can program to perform a variety of tasks. The explanation of the GET
statement in Chapter 5 tells you how to program function keys in BASIC.

&lt;CTRL&gt;                   The ConTRoL key lets you set colors and do other
                       special tasks called control functions.
                         To  set  colors,  hold down the &lt;CTRL&gt; key while
                       you press the key with the color you want. You can
                       get eight more colors with the &lt;C=&gt; key. Chapter 6
                       also has more about colors.
                         To get a control function,  hold the  &lt;CTRL&gt; key
                       down  while  you  press  the  other  key.  Control
                       functions   are   commonly   used  in  prepackaged
                       software such as a word processing system.

&lt;RUN/STOP&gt;               You  can  halt a BASIC program while it is still
                       RUNning by pressing the  &lt;STOP&gt; key.  You can also
                       use the  &lt;STOP&gt; key to halt a printout while it is
                       still printing.
                         &lt;RUN&gt;  lets  you  load  a  program automatically
                       from cassette. When you want to use the &lt;RUN&gt; key,
                       you must also use the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key.

&lt;C=&gt; COMMODORE KEY       The Commodore key &lt;C=&gt; can do two things:
                       1. &lt;C=&gt; lets you switch back and forth between the
                          upper and lower case display mode  (the letters
                          and characters on the tops of the keys) and the
                          upper   case/graphic   display   mode  (capital
                          letters  and  the graphics on the fronts of the
                          keys).
                            To switch modes,  press the  &lt;C=&gt; and &lt;SHIFT&gt;
                          keys at the same time.
                            When you first turn on your 64,  it is in the
                          upper   case/graphic  mode,  which  means  that
                          everything  you  type in is in capital letters.
                          When  you are in this mode,  you can also print
                          all the graphics on the fronts of the keys.

                          o To  print  the graphic on the right side of a
                            key,  hold  down  the  &lt;SHIFT&gt;  key while you
                            press  the  key  with the graphic you want to
                            print.  You  can  only  print  the right side
                            graphics  when  you  are  in  the upper case/
                            graphic mode.
                          o To  print  the  graphic on the left side of a
                            key,  hold down the  &lt;C=&gt; key while you press
                            the graphic key.  You can print the left side
                            graphic in either mode.

                       2. The  &lt;C=&gt;  key also lets you use the second set
                          of  eight  alternate  colors  not  shown on the
                          color  keys.  To  get these other colors,  hold
                          down  the  &lt;C=&gt;  key while you press the number
                          for the color you want.

                              &lt;C=&gt; 1  ORANGE        &lt;C=&gt; 5  GREY 2
                              &lt;C=&gt; 2  BROWN         &lt;C=&gt; 6  LT. GREEN
                              &lt;C=&gt; 3  LT. RED       &lt;C=&gt; 7  LT. BLUE
                              &lt;C=&gt; 4  GREY 1        &lt;C=&gt; 8  GREY 3


2.2. LOADING PROGRAMS

  The  COMMODORE  64  accepts  programs from disk, cartridge, or cassette
tapes.  This  means you can use prewritten software simply by loading it.
But  more important, the 64 lets you save your own programs for reuse. To
reuse  a  program you wrote and saved on disk or tape, all you do is load
and run it.
  When  you  use  tapes or disks with your COMMODORE 64 be sure that your
disk drive or cassette unit is correctly connected.


Loading Cartridges

  You can use a special line of programs and games on cartridge with your
64.  The  programs  include  a  wide  variety  of  business  and personal
applications. The games are just like real arcade games, not imitations.
  Follow these steps to load games and other cartridges:

1. Turn OFF your COMMODORE 64.
   YOU  MUST  TURN  OFF  YOUR  COMMODORE  64  BEFORE YOU INSERT OR REMOVE
   CARTRIDGES.  IF  YOU  DON'T,  YOU  MAY  DAMAGE  THE  CARTRIDGE AND THE
   COMPUTER.
2. Insert  the  cartridge label uppermost in the slot on the back of your
   computer.
3. Turn on your 64.
4. Begin  the  game  by  typing the START key that's listed in the game's
   instruction sheet.


Loading Prepackaged Cassette Tapes

  You can also buy prepackaged software on cassette tape. These cassettes
are just like the ones with recorded music that you can play on a stereo.

1. Insert the cassette into your 1530 DATASSETTE recorder.
2. Make sure the tape is completely rewound to the beginning of the first
   side.
3. Type LOAD on your keyboard. The computer answers by displaying:

                           PRESS PLAY ON TAPE

4. Press  PLAY  on  your  DATASSETTE.  The  screen  goes  blank until the
   computer finds the program. Then the screen displays the message FOUND
   (PROGRAM NAME).
5. Press the &lt;C=&gt; key. This actually loads the program into the computer.
   If you want to stop the loading, press the &lt;RUN/STOP&gt; key.


Loading Your Own Programs From Cassette Tape

  The  COMMODORE  64  lets  you  write  and save programs on any brand of
cassette  tape.  All  you need is a 1530 DATASSETTE recorder and the same
kind of blank tape you'd use to record music for a stereo tape player.
  Follow  these  simple  steps  to  load a program you wrote and saved on
tape:

1. Rewind the tape to the beginning.
2. Type LOAD &quot;PROGRAM NAME&quot;. If you don't remember the program name, just
   type LOAD. This loads the first program on the tape into memory.
3. Press &lt;RETURN&gt;. The computer responds with:

                           PRESS PLAY ON TAPE

4. Press the PLAY key.  The screen goes blank while the computer searches
   for the program. When the program is found, the screen displays this
   message:
                           FOUND PROGRAM NAME

5. Press the &lt;C=&gt; key to actually load the program. The screen again goes
   blank during LOADing. When the program is LOADed, the screen returns
   to normal and the READY prompt appears. If you want to abort the
   loading, press the &lt;RUN/STOP&gt; key.

NOTE:  When  you  load  a  new  program  into  the computer's memory, any
instructions  and  unsaved  programs  in the computer are erased and lost
permanently.  Before you LOAD a new program,  be sure everything you want
to keep is saved.
  After your program is LOADed, you can RUN it, LIST it, or make changes.
Remember  that  you  have to reSAVE a changed program if you want to keep
the new version.


Loading Disks

  Disks,  which are often called &quot;floppy disks&quot;,  are really easy to use.
The  advantage  of  disks  over tapes is that you can find data stored on
disks  much  faster.  You  can also save much more data on a disk than on
tape.
  The  steps  are the same for loading preprogrammed disks and disks that
you program yourself.

1. Insert a disk into your disk drive. Make sure the label on the disk is
   facing up.  Put the disk in so that the labeled end goes in last. Look
   for  a  little  notch  on  the disk (it might be covered with a little
   piece of tape).  This notch must be on the left side as you put in the
   disk,  assuming that you're facing your computer.  Be sure the disk is
   all the way in.
2. Close the protective gate on the disk drive after you insert the disk.
   Just push down the lever.
4. Type  LOAD&quot;PROGRAM NAME&quot;,8.  The 8 is the code for disks.  You need to
   type it here to let the computer know you're loading a disk.

   NOTE:  You  can LOAD the first program by using the * sign in place of
   the program name: LOAD&quot;*&quot;,8.

4. Press the &lt;RETURN&gt; key. The disk will spin and your screen will say:

   SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME
   LOADING
   READY
   _

5. Type  RUN  when  the  screen  says  READY and the cursor appears. Your
   software is ready to use.


2.3. HOW TO FORMAT A NEW DISK

  When you're using a new, unprogrammed disk for the first time, you need
to format it.  Formatting,  which is also called headering, prepares your
disk by doing things like dividing the disk into blocks.  Formatting also
creates a directory that you use as a table of contents for the files you
save on the disk. DO NOT header a preprogrammed disk.
  You only have to format new disks, not disks that already have programs
on them unless you want to erase the entire disk and reuse it.
  To  format  a  new  disk,  use this special version of the OPEN and NEW
commands:

  OPEN 1,8,15,&quot;N0:&lt;name&gt;,&lt;id&gt;&quot;

  N0 tells the computer to header (NEW) the disk in drive 0.  If you have
a  dual  disk  drive connected (via a suitable interface) header disks in
drive 0.
  The &lt;name&gt; you use in this command goes in the directory as the name of
the entire disk. Give the disk any name up to 16 characters.
  The &lt;id&gt; is any two characters.  Give the disk any &lt;id&gt; you  want,  but
you should give every disk a different &lt;id&gt; code.
  When the disk drive light goes off, type CLOSE 1 and press &lt;RETURN&gt;.

BE CAREFUL! Headering a disk erases all information on the disk, if there
is  any.  Header only a new disk or a disk you are willing to erase. Here
are some examples of formatting commands that header a disk:

  OPEN 1,8,15,&quot;N0:MYFILE,A3&quot;
  OPEN 1,8,15,&quot;N0:$RECORDS,02&quot;

  Now  that you know how to header a disk,  you are ready to use disks to
write  and  save programs on your COMMODORE 64.  Appendix S contains more
information on the OPEN command.


2.4. SAVING PROGRAMS

  When  you  want  to reuse a program you've written,  be sure to SAVE it
before you LOAD another program. If you don't, you'll lose the program.
  When you change a SAVEd program,  you have to SAVE it again if you want
to keep the new version.
  When  you reSAVE a program,  you are replacing the old version with the
new  one.  If you want to keep both the old and the changed versions, you
have to give the new one a different name when you SAVE it.


Saving on Disk

  When  you  want to SAVE a program you've written on disk,  follow these
simple steps:

1. Key in SAVE&quot;PROGRAM NAME&quot;,8. The 8 is the code for disks. It tells the
   computer that you're using a disk.
2. Press &lt;RETURN&gt;. The disk makes a noise, and the computer displays this
   message when the program is saved:

   SAVING PROGRAM NAME
   OK
   READY
   _


Saving on Cassette Tape

  When you want to SAVE a program you've written on cassette tape, follow
these steps:

1. Key  in  SAVE&quot;PROGRAM NAME&quot;.  The program name you use can be up to 16
   characters long.
2. Press the &lt;RETURN&gt; key. The computer displays the message PRESS RECORD
   AND PLAY ON TAPE.
3. Press the RECORD and PLAY keys on your DATASSETTE recorder. The screen
   goes  blank  and  turns  the  color  of  the border.  The READY prompt
   reappears when the program is SAVEd.


2.5. LISTING A DIRECTORY OF PROGRAMS ON A DISK

  When  you  SAVE programs on a disk,  the computer automatically makes a
table  of contents,  or a DIRECTORY,  of the names of the programs on the
disk.  You  can  display  this directory to see what programs are on your
disk. Follow these steps:

1. Key  in:  LOAD&quot;$&quot;,8  and  press  &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The computer displays this
   message:

   SEARCHING FOR $
   LOADING
   READY
   _

2. Key in: LIST and press &lt;RETURN&gt;.
  Your programs names are displayed on your screen.



3. BEGINNING BASIC


3.1. PRINTING AND CALCULATING

  If you don't know BASIC, this section teaches you how to do some simple
things like print words and calculate problems.
  The  PRINT  statement  tells  the 64 computer to print something on the
screen.  PRINT  is  one  of  the most useful and powerful commands in the
BASIC language.  You can use it to display just about anything, including
graphics  and  the  results  of  computations.  To use the PRINT command,
follow these steps:

1. Key  in  the word PRINT.  This tells the computer what kind of job you
   want it to do.
2. Key in a quotation mark. This tells the computer where the message you
   want to print begins.
3. Key in whatever you want to print on the screen.
4. Key  in  a  closing quotation mark.  This tells the computer where the
   message you want to print ends.
5. Press  the  &lt;RETURN&gt;  key.  This  tells  the  computer  to follow your
   instructions,  which  in this case is to print your message exactly as
   you typed it.

  When  you  follow  these  steps,  the  computer prints your message and
displays the READY prompt. It looks like this:

  PRINT &quot;I LOVE MY COMMODORE&quot;        You key in this and press &lt;RETURN&gt;
  I LOVE MY COMMODORE                The computer prints this
  READY
  _

  The  64 prints whatever you enclose in quotes.  Remember to key in both
quotation marks.
  If you make a mistake in your PRINT statement,  use the INST/DEL key to
correct your error.  You can change as many characters as you like before
you press the &lt;RETURN&gt; key.
  If  you  made  a  mistake  that you didn't catch before you pressed the
&lt;RETURN&gt; key,  the computer can't follow your instructions.  Instead,  it
displays an error message to help you figure out what you did wrong.  For
example:

  ?SYNTAX ERROR

  If you get this message,  check over what you typed in to see where you
made  a  mistake.  The  computer  is  very  precise,  and it can't follow
instructions  that  contain  spelling errors or other mistakes.  To avoid
mistakes, be sure you type things in the correct form.
  Remember  that  the best way to get to know BASIC and your 64 is to try
different things and see what happens.


USING PRINT TO CALCULATE

  You  can  use  PRINT  to  do  more  than  just  display what you put in
quotation  marks.  You  can  also  use  it  to  perform  calculations and
automatically display the results. Follow these steps:

1. Key in PRINT.
2. Key  in  the  calculation  you  want  to  solve.  DON'T  enclose it in
   quotation marks.
3. Press  the &lt;RETURN&gt; key.  The computer displays the answer followed by
   the READY prompt.

Here's an example:

  PRINT 12 + 12         Type this line and press &lt;RETURN&gt;
  24
  READY                 The computer displays
  _                     the answer

  Be sure you leave off the quotation marks when you want the computer to
solve  a  problem.  If  you  type the problem inside quotation marks, the
computer assumes you just want to display the problem, not solve it.  For
example:

  PRINT &quot;12 + 12&quot;       Key in this line and press &lt;RETURN&gt;
  12 + 12
  READY                 The computer displays
  _                     what's in quotes

  So  all  you  have  to  do  to  use  PRINT  as a calculator is omit the
quotation marks. You can use PRINT to add, subtract, multiply and divide.
You  can  also  use exponents and perform advanced mathematical functions
such as figuring square roots.


3.2. MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS

ADDITION

  Use the plus sign (+) to tell the computer to add numbers.  Remember to
press  &lt;RETURN&gt; after you type PRINT and the calculation.  This tells the
computer to follow your instructions.

SUBTRACTION

  Use the minus sign (-) to subtract.  Press the  &lt;RETURN&gt; key at the end
of the calculation. For example:

  PRINT 12 - 9                    Key in this and &lt;RETURN&gt;
  3                               The computer displays this

MULTIPLICATION

  Use  the  asterisk  (*)  to multiply.  You can't use the conventional x
because   the   computer   would  think  it's  the  letter  x,   not  the
multiplication sign.  Press  &lt;RETURN&gt; at the end of the calculation.  For
example:

  PRINT 12 * 12                   Key in this and &lt;RETURN&gt;
  144                             The computer displays this

DIVISION

  Use the slash mark (/) for division.  Press the  &lt;RETURN&gt; key after you
type the calculation. For example:

  PRINT 144/12                    Key in this and &lt;RETURN&gt;
  12                              The computer displays this

EXPONENTIATION

  Use the up arrow (^) to raise a number to a power.  Press the  &lt;RETURN&gt;
key after you type the calculation.  For example, to find 12 to the fifth
power, type this:

  PRINT 12^5                      Key in this and &lt;RETURN&gt;
  248832                          The computer displays this

  This is the same as:

  PRINT 12*12*12*12*12
  248832

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIP:                                                                  |
| BASIC has shortcuts that make programming even faster.  One  shortcut |
| is abbreviating BASIC keywords. For example, you can use a ? in place |
| of  PRINT.  Throughout this book,  we'll show you other abbreviations |
| for  BASIC  keywords.  Appendix D lists these abbreviations and shows |
| what is displayed on the screen when you type the abbreviated form.   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


3.3. MULTIPLE CALCULATIONS ON ONE LINE

  The  last  example shows that you can perform more than one calculation
on  a  line.  You can also perform different kinds of calculations on the
same line. For example:

  ? 3 * 5 - 7 + 2                 Key in this and &lt;RETURN&gt;
  10                              The computer displays this

  So  far  our  examples have used small numbers and simple problems. But
the 64 can do much more complex calculations. The next example adds large
numbers.
  Notice that 78956.87 doesn't have a comma between the 8 and the 9.  You
can't  use  commas  this  way in BASIC.  BASIC thinks commas indicate new
numbers,  so it would think  78,956.87  is two numbers:  78  and  956.87.
Remember to press &lt;RETURN&gt; after you type the problem.

  ? 1234.5 + 3457.8 + 78956.87
  83649.17

  The next example uses a ten digit number.  The 64 can work with numbers
that  have  up  to  ten  digits,  but can only display nine digits in the
answer.  So the 64 rounds numbers that are more than nine digits. Numbers
five  and  over  are  rounded up,  and numbers four and under are rounded
down.  This  means that 12123123.45 is rounded to 12123123.5.  Because of
rounding,  the  computer  doesn't  give  the same answer you'd get if you
added  these  numbers by hand.  In this case, the answer is 12131364.817.
You can see the difference rounding makes.

  ? 12123123.45 + 345.78 + 7895.687
  12131364.9

  The  64  prints numbers between  0.01  and  999,999,999  using standard
notation, except for leaving out commas in large numbers. Numbers outside
this  range  are  printed using scientific notation.  Scientific notation
lets you express a very large or very small number as a power of 10.  For
example:

  ? 123000000000000000
  1.23E+17

  Another way of expressing this number is  1.23 * 10 ^ 17.  The  64 uses
scientific  notation  for numbers with lots of digits to make them easier
to read.
  There  is  a  limit to the numbers the computer can handle,  even using
scientific notation. These limits are:

  Largest numbers : +/- 1.70141183E+38
  Smallest numbers: +/- 2.93873588E-39


3.4. EXECUTION ORDER IN CALCULATIONS

  If you tried to perform some mixed calculations of your own,  you might
not  have  gotten the results you expected.  This is because the computer
performs calculations in a certain order.
  In this calculation:

  20 + 8 / 2

the answer is 14 if you add 20 to 8 first,  and  then divide 28 by 4. But
the answer is 24 if you first divide 8 by 2, and then add 20 and 4.
  On  the  64,  you  always  get  24 because the computer always performs
calculations  in the same order.  Problems are solved from left to right,
but  within  that  general  movement,  some  types  of  calculations take
precedence over others. Here is the order of precedence:

  First :   -     minus sign for negative numbers, not for subtraction.
  Second:   ^     exponentiation, left to right
  Third :   * /   multiplication and division, left to right
  Fourth:   + -   addition and subtraction, left to right

  This  means that the computer checks the whole calculation for negative
numbers before doing anything else.  Then it looks for exponents; then it
performs all multiplication and division; then it adds and subtracts.
  This explains why  20 + 8 / 2  is  24:  8 is divided by 2  before 20 is
added because division has precedence over addition.
  There  is an easy way to override the order of precedence:  enclose any
calculation you want solved first in parentheses.  If you add parentheses
to the equation shown above, here's what happens:

  ? (20 + 8) / 2
  14

  You  get  14  because the parentheses allow 20 and 8 to be added before
the division occurs.
  Here's another example that shows how you can change the order, and the
answer, with parentheses:

  ? 30 + 15 * 2 - 3
  57

  ? (30 + 15) * 2 - 3
  87

  ? 30 + 15 * (2 - 3)
  15

  ? (30 + 15) * (2 - 3)
  -45

  The last example has two calculations in parentheses. As usual, they're
evaluated from left to right, and then the rest of the problem is solved.
When  you have more than one calculation in parentheses,  you can further
control the order by using parentheses within parentheses. The problem in
the innermost parentheses is solved first. For example:

  ? 30 + (15 * (2 - 3))
  15

  In this case,  3 is subtracted from 2, then 15 is multiplied by -1, and
-15  is added to 30.  As you experiment with solving calculations, you'll
get familiar with the order in which mixed calculations are solved.


3.5. COMBINING PRINT'S CAPABILITIES

  The 64 computers let you combine the two types of print statements that
you've  read  about  in this book.  Remember that anything you enclose in
quotation marks is displayed exactly as you type it.
  The  next  example  shows  how  you  can  combine  the  types  of PRINT
statements.  The  equation  enclosed in quotes is displayed without being
solved. The equation not in quotes is solved. The semicolon separates the
two parts of the PRINT statement (semicolon means no space).

  ? &quot;5 * 9 =&quot;; 5 * 9              You key in this and &lt;RETURN&gt;
  5 * 9 = 45                      The computer displays this

  Remember,  only  the  second  part of the statement actually solves the
calculation.  The two parts are separated by a semicolon. You always have
to  separate  the  parts of a mixed PRINT statement with some punctuation
for  it  to work the way you want it to.  If you use a comma instead of a
semicolon,  there  is  more  space  between  the  two  parts when they're
displayed. A semicolon leaves out space.
  The 64's screen is organized into 4 zones of 10 columns each.  When you
use a comma to separate parts of a PRINT statement,  the comma works as a
tab, sending each result into the next zone. For example:

  ? &quot;TOTAL:&quot;;95,&quot;SHORTAGE:&quot;;15
  TOTAL: 95           SHORTAGE: 15

  If you have more than four results, they are automatically displayed on
the next line. For example:

  ? 2 * 3,4 - 6,2 ^ 3,6 / 4,100 + (-48)
  6        -2         8         1.5
  52

  Here's the difference when you use semicolons:

  ? 2 * 3;4 - 6;2 ^ 3;6 / 4;100 + (-48)
  6 -2  8  1.5  52

  You  can  use  the  difference  between  the comma and the semicolon in
formatting PRINT statements to create complex displays.



4. WRITING SIMPLE BASIC PROGRAMS


  So  far  this  book has shown you how to do simple things with your 64.
You've  experimented  with  typing single lines of instructions into your
computer  and getting instant results by pressing the &lt;RETURN&gt; key.  This
easy  way  of  doing  things  on your computer is called the IMMEDIATE or
CALCULATOR mode.
  But  you'll  probably want to use your computer to do more complex jobs
that use more than one statement. When you combine a number of statements
into a PROGRAM, you can use the full power of your 64.
  To  see how easy it is to write your first program on 64,  follow these
steps:

1. Clear the screen by holding down the  &lt;SHIFT&gt;  key while you press the
   &lt;CLR/HOME&gt; key.
2. Key in NEW and press &lt;RETURN&gt;.  This clears out information that might
   still be in the computer's memory after your experimenting.
3. Key in the following two lines exactly as they appear here:

   10 ? &quot;COMMODORE 64&quot;
   20 GOTO 10

4. Remember to press the  &lt;RETURN&gt; key after each line.  After you key in
   the  first  line and press  &lt;RETURN&gt;,  you'll notice that the computer
   doesn't  respond  to  the  PRINT command right away like it did before
   when  you typed in the same kind of commands.  This is because you are
   now beginning the command with a line number  (10).  When you use line
   numbers, the computer knows that you're writing a program, so it waits
   for  you to finish keying in the whole program before following any of
   your instructions.
5. Key in RUN and press &lt;RETURN&gt;. The RUN command tells the computer that
   you've finished keying in program statements, and you're ready to have
   your  instructions  followed.  Here's  what  happens when you RUN this
   program:

   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64

6. Stop the program's execution by pressing the &lt;STOP&gt; key.  The computer
   continues to follow your orders by printing COMMODORE 64 over and over
   until you interrupt with the &lt;STOP&gt; key.  Here's how your screen looks
   when you press STOP.

   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   COMMODORE 64
   BREAK IN 10
   READY

  This  simple program introduces several important concepts that are the
basis for all programming.


4.1. LINE NUMBERS

  We  mentioned before in step 4 that line numbers tell the computer that
you're  writing a program.  They also tell the computer in what order you
want  the statements in your program to execute.  Without line numbers to
tell the computer when to follow which instruction,  the computer doesn't
know what to do first.
  The  longer and more complex your program is,  the more important it is
to remember that the computer relies on you to tell it WHEN to do things,
as  well as WHAT to do.  One good thing about this is that you can key in
line  20 before line 10 because the computer just checks the line numbers
to  find  out  the order for executing the program.  The computer doesn't
check for the order your lines appear on the screen.
  Another  advantage  of  line  numbers is that you can use the number to
refer  to  the statement on the line. When you want to go back and repeat
the execution of a statement, all you do is refer to it by line number in
a GOTO statement, as you did in the example above.


4.2. THE GOTO STATEMENT

  When  you told the computer to RUN the sample program above,  COMMODORE
64  was  PRINTed  repeatedly  instead  of  just  once because of the GOTO
statement in line 20.
  The  GOTO  statement  tells  the computer to go directly to a specified
line.  Then  the  computer follows the instructions in the specified line
and goes on to the next line.
  You can use a  GOTO statement to tell the computer to go back to a line
that's  already  been  executed.  Or  GOTO  can tell the computer to skip
forward,  even  if  this  means  that some lines in the program don't get
executed.
  In our example,  the program PRINTs the message in line 10 and moves to
line 20.  There, the GOTO statement tells the computer to go back to line
10 and do what line 10 says to do.  So, the program prints the message in
line 10 again,  and then moves to line 20,  which sends the computer back
to line 10 and so on.
  This repetition is called a LOOP.  Because the example doesn't give the
computer a way out of the loop, the circle repeats endlessly. You have to
halt the cycle by interrupting the program with the &lt;STOP&gt; key.
  It's  best to include a statement in your program that ends the loop so
you  don't  have  to use the &lt;STOP&gt; key.  We'll explain more above ending
loops later in this chapter.


4.3. USING THE LIST COMMAND

  Now  that  you've interrupted execution of the sample program,  type in
LIST  and  press  &lt;RETURN&gt;.  Your program is now displayed intact because
it's  still  in  the  computer's memory,  even though you interrupted the
program's  execution.  The  only  difference is that the computer changed
your ? into the word PRINT.  This doesn't affect your program,  it's just
the  way  the computer  does things.  When you use the LIST command,  the
computer  also  displays  the  lines  of the program in correct numerical
order, even if you entered the lines out of order.
  One  of the important differences between writing programs and entering
single  lines  in  the  immediate/calculator mode is that you permanently
lose  an  immediate  statement  once you execute it and clear the screen.
But,  until  you  start a new program,  you can always get a program back
just by keying in LIST.
  From here, you can change the program, SAVE it, or RUN it again.


4.4. EDITING TIPS

  When  you  make  a mistake in a line you've keyed in,  or when you just
want to change a line, the 64 offers you a number of editing options.

1. You  can  retype  a  line  any  time,  and  the computer automatically
   substitutes  the  new  line  for  the  old one.  All you have to do to
   replace a line is use the same line number. For example:

   10 ? &quot;MY NAME IS SARAH&quot;
   20 ? &quot;I WAS BORN IN CALIFORNIA&quot;
   20 ? &quot;I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA&quot;
   RUN
   MY NAME IS SARAH
   I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA

     As  you  can  see,  the  first  line 20 never executes because it is
   replaced  by  the  second  line 20.  If you now key in a LIST command,
   you'll see that only the second line 20 is still part of the program.
2. You  can easily erase a line you don't want just by keying in the line
   number and pressing the &lt;RETURN&gt; key.  If you now key in LIST,  you'll
   see that the line is gone, and so is the line number.
3. You can easily edit an existing line.  Use the CuRSoR keys to move the
   cursor  back  to  the line you want to change,  and then just edit the
   line any way you want to.  As soon as you press the &lt;RETURN&gt; key,  the
   edited line will replace the old line.  Remember to use the &lt;INST/DEL&gt;
   key to insert or delete.

  When  you  finish  editing,  you can check your program again to verify
changes by keying in the LIST command. Remember that LIST also puts lines
in numerical order if you've keyed them in out of order.
  Try  editing our sample program by adding a semicolon to the end of the
line, and omitting the 64.  After you finish the changes, be sure to move
the  cursor  past  line  20  before  you RUN the program.  Here's how the
program works now:

  LIST
  10 PRINT &quot;COMMODORE&quot;;
  20 GOTO 10

  RUN
  COMMODORE   COMMODORE   COMMODORE   COMMODORE
  COMMODORE   COMMODORE   COMMODORE   COMMODORE
  BREAK IN 10
  READY


4.5. HOW TO USE VARIABLES

  A variable is a symbol that stands for a value.  Sometimes the value of
a variable is unknown before you RUN a program.  One of the purposes of a
program  may  be to find one or more values for a variable.  Look at this
line from a program:

  20 LET X = 28 + Y

  The  = sign means &quot;become&quot; or &quot;take the value of&quot;.  The LET instruction
is optional and may be omitted.

  In  this  equation,  X  and  Y are variables.  Suppose X stands for the
number  of  days  in a month.  One of the best things about a variable is
that  you  can reuse it in a program,  so X can stand for the days in all
the months, not just one month. This is where Y comes in. All months have
28 days, so Y stands for the days over 28.  Later in this chapter there's
a program that gives values to these two variables.
  The  most  important  thing  now  is  understanding how variables work,
because  variables  allow  you  to  do  complex tasks with your computer.
Variables also let you write programs that are very reusable.
  Imagine  that  your  computer contains a bunch of little slots,  like a
bank  of mail boxes.  When you write a program, you can use some of these
slots  to  hold values.  All you do is give a name to the slots you need,
and  during  the  program  you can put values into each slot by using the
slot's  name.  For example,  in the equation above,  we used two slots by
naming one X and one Y.  At the beginning of a program,  these slots have
names, but they're empty. Here's what happens when you put a value in Y's
slot:

  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
  |   X    |   Y    |        |        |        |        |        |
  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
  |        |   3    |        |        |        |        |        |
  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  Now the variable  Y has the value 3.  You can give Y this value just by
writing this simple statement:

  10 Y = 3

  Since  X  equals  28  plus Y,  when you RUN the program X's slot gets a
value, too.

  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
  |   X    |   Y    |        |        |        |        |        |
  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
  |   31   |   3    |        |        |        |        |        |
  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  Here's how the program looks:

  10 Y = 3
  20 X = 28 + Y
  30 ? &quot;THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN MAY IS &quot;;X

  RUN
  THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN MAY IS 31

  Here's another program that uses variables:

  10 X% = 15
  20 X = 23.5
  30 X$ = &quot;TOTAL:&quot;
  40 Y = X% + X
  50 ? X$;Y

  When you RUN the program, the imaginary slots look like this after line
30 is executed:

  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
  |   X%   |   X    |   X$   |   Y    |        |
  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
  |   15   |  23.5  | TOTAL: |        |        |
  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  On completion of the program, Y has the value: 38.5

  The above example uses the three types of variables:
                                                             EXAMPLE
  TYPE          SYMBOL    DESCRIPTION         EXAMPLES       VALUES
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Integer       %         whole numbers       X%, A1%        15,102,3
  Text string   $         characters in       X$, AB$        &quot;TOTAL:&quot;,
                          quotes                             &quot;DAY 1&quot;
  Floating                real (decimal)      X, AB          23.5, 12,
  point                   or whole numbers                   1.3E+2

  Be  sure you use the right variable types in your programs.  If you try
to  do  something like assign a text string to an integer variable,  your
program won't work.
  There  are  a few other things to keep in mind when you assign names to
variables:

  o  A  variable  name  can have one or two characters,  not counting the
     special symbol used with integer and text string variables.
  o  You  can use more than two alphabetic characters in a variable name,
     but the computer only recognizes the first two.  So the computer
     would think PA, PARTNO and PAGENO are the same variable referring to
     the same &quot;slot&quot;.
  o  A  program is easier for people to read when you use longer variable
     names, but when you use more than two characters in a name,  be sure
     the first two are unique.
  o  You can use X, X%, and X$ in one program because the special symbols
     % and $ make each variable name unique. The same is true of A2, A2%,
     and A2$.
  o  The first character must be alphabetic (A to Z).  The second and any
     later  characters  can  be  either  alphabetic or numeric  (0 to 9).
     Remember  that the computer ignores every character after the second
     unless it's a % or $ in the third position.
  o  Variable  names can't contain BASIC keywords,  which are also called
     reserved words. These are the words like PRINT and RUN that are part
     of  the  BASIC  language.  Appendix  D  lists all the BASIC reserved
     words.

  Here's  one  more  sample  program that shows you how to use variables.
This example also uses some of the other things you've learned so far.

  NEW
  10 X = 1.05
  20 Y = 300
  30 Z = X * Y
  40 PRINT &quot;SEATS AVAILABLE:&quot;;Y
  50 PRINT &quot;TICKETS AVAILABLE:&quot;;Z
  60 Y = Y + 1
  70 PRINT &quot;OVERBOOKING POINT:&quot;;Y

  RUN
  SEATS AVAILABLE: 300
  TICKETS AVAILABLE: 315
  OVERBOOKING POINT: 301

  Lines (10-30) assign variable names.
  Lines 40  and  50  PRINT a message and the current value of variables Y
and Z. Notice that at line 40, the value for Y is 300.
  Line 60 gives Y a new value,  and this new value is PRINTed in line 70.
Line 60 shows that a variable can have more than one value in a program.
  Line 60  also shows another of the powerful features of variables:  you
can make a variable equal to itself and another value. This isn't allowed
in  regular  algebra,  but  this  kind  of  statement is commonly used in
programming.  It means: take the current value of a variable,  combine it
with another value, and replace the first value of the variable with this
new value. You can also use statements like these:

  Y = Y - 1
  Y = Y + X
  Y = Y / 2
  Y = Y * (X + 2)


4.6. USING FOR/NEXT LOOPS

  We  mentioned  loops  earlier in this chapter during the explanation of
the  GOTO statement.  As you'll recall,  loops are repeated executions of
one or more lines in a program.
  The  FOR/NEXT  statement lets you create very useful loops that control
the number of times a segment of a program is executed. The FOR statement
sets  a limit on the number of times the loop will execute by assigning a
range of values to a variable. For example:

  FOR COUNT=1 TO 4

  The  NEXT statement marks the end of a FOR/NEXT loop.  When the program
reaches a NEXT statement, the computer checks the FOR statement to see if
the limit of the loop has been reached. If the limit hasn't been reached,
the  loop  continues and the variable in the FOR statement is incremented
by one.  For example,  if you add a  FOR/NEXT  loop to the program at the
beginning of this chapter, here's what happens:

  10 FOR CT =1 TO 4
  20 ? &quot;COMMODORE 64&quot;
  30 NEXT CT

  RUN
  COMMODORE 64
  COMMODORE 64
  COMMODORE 64
  COMMODORE 64

  Now  that  you've  added the FOR/NEXT loop,  you don't have to break in
with the STOP key to halt the program's execution.
  This FOR/NEXT loop works like this:

  Line 10 gives the variable CT a range of values from 1 to 4,  and tells
the computer to execute the next lines until CT equals 4.
  Line 20 tells the computer to print COMMODORE 64.
  Line 30 tells the computer to add 1 to the current value of CT. As long
as  the  value  of  CT  remains  within the range of 1 to 4,  the program
repeats,  and  COMMODORE 64 is PRINTed again.  When CT equals 4,  line 20
executes  one  more time.  When line 30 again adds 1 to CT,  the computer
knows  that  CT is now out of range.  So the computer stops executing the
loop, and the program ends by itself.
  To make sure you understand how the FOR/NEXT loop works, we'll add more
PRINT statements to line 20 that let you keep track of the value of CT.

  20 PRINT&quot;COMMODORE 64  &quot;;&quot;COUNT =&quot;;CT

  RUN
  COMMODORE  64  COUNT = 1
  COMMODORE  64  COUNT = 2
  COMMODORE  64  COUNT = 3
  COMMODORE  64  COUNT = 4

  As  you  can see,  the program ends automatically when CT is out of the
range set up in the FOR statement.
  You can increment the value of the variable in a  FOR/NEXT statement by
values other than 1.  All you do is add both the word  STEP and the value
you want to use to the end of the FOR statement. For example:

  NEW
  10 FOR NB=1 TO 10 STEP .5   This comma tells the computer to print each
  20 PRINT NB,                value  beginning  at  the first position of
  30 NEXT NB                  the next 10 space zone.
  RUN
   1         1.5       2         2.5
   3         3.5       4         4.5
   5         5.5       6         6.5
   7         7.5       8         8.5
   9         9.5       10

  NEW
  10 FOR A=2 TO 8 STEP 2
  20 PRINT A,
  30 NEXT A
  RUN
   2         4         6         8

  You can also use a FOR/NEXT loop to count backwards.  When you do this,
make sure your  STEP is negative.  For example,  if you change line 10 to
this:

  10 FOR A=8 TO 2 STEP -2

  Here's how the output looks:

  RUN
   8         6         4         2


4.7. USING IF/THEN STATEMENTS TO CONTROL PROGRAMS

  An IF/THEN statement is another way to control program execution.  This
statement  tells  the  computer to check IF a condition is true.  IF that
condition is true, the instructions after the word THEN execute.  IF that
condition  is  false,  the  program  goes  on  to  the  next line without
following the instructions in the THEN statement. For example:

  10 X = 60
  20 X = X + 1
  30 IF X = 64 THEN PRINT &quot;GOT IT&quot;: END
  40 GOTO 20

  You  can  use  an  IF  statement  to  start a loop or to decide whether
certain parts of program will execute. For example:

  10 A = 0
  20 IF A &lt;= 8 THEN 40
  30 END
  40 ? &quot;FRODO LIVES &quot;;A
  50 A = A + 2
  60 GOTO 20

  RUN
  FRODO LIVES  0
  FRODO LIVES  2
  FRODO LIVES  4
  FRODO LIVES  6
  FRODO LIVES  8

  In this example, the IF/THEN statement in line 20 tells the computer to
check the current value of A.  IF A is equal to or less than 8,  THEN the
program skips line 30 and continues RUNning at line 40. IF A is more than
8,  in  other words,  IF the condition in line 20 is false,  the computer
ignores the instructions after the THEN statement.
  IF line 20 is false, THEN line 30 is executed.
  Line 40 PRINTs the message and the current value of A.
  Line 50 adds 2 to the value of A each time the loop RUNs.  As soon as A
becomes 10,  line 20 becomes false, line 30 becomes true, and the program
ends immediately.
  You can use any of these relational operators in IF/THEN statements:

  SYMBOL           MEANING

    &lt;              Less than
    &gt;              Greater than
    =              Equal to
   &lt; &gt;             Not equal to
   &gt; =             Greater than or equal to
   &lt; =             Less than or equal to



5. ADVANCED BASIC


  The  next  few  chapters  are  for  people  who are familiar with BASIC
programming  language  and  the  concepts  necessary  to  write  advanced
programs.
  Those  of  you  who  are just starting to learn how to program may find
some  of  the  information  too  technical  to understand completely. But
you'll  find  some  simple examples that are written for new users in two
chapters,  SPRITE  GRAPHICS  and CREATING SOUND. These examples will give
you  a  good  idea  of  how  to  use the sophisticated graphics and sound
capabilities available on your 64.
  If  you  want  to learn more about writing programs in BASIC, check the
bibliography in the back of this manual (Appendix N).
  If  you  are  already  familiar  with  BASIC programming, the following
chapters  will  help  you  get  started  with  advanced BASIC programming
techniques.  You'll find extensive information about advanced programming
in  the  COMMODORE  64  PROGRAMMER'S  REFERENCE GUIDE, which is available
through your local Commodore dealer.


5.1. SIMPLE ANIMATION

  You  can  use some of the 64's graphic capabilities by putting together
what you've learned so far in this manual, along with a few new concepts.
  Try  entering  the  following  program  to  see  what  you  can do with
graphics. Notice that you can include cursor controls and screen commands
within  a  PRINT  statement. When you see something like (CRSR left) in a
program  listing,  hold  down  the  &lt;SHIFT&gt; key and press the &lt;CRSR-LEFT/
RIGHT&gt; key. The screen shows the graphic representation of a cursor left,
which  is  two vertical reversed bars.  The graphic representation of the
SHIFTed &lt;CLR/HOME&gt; key is a reversed heart.

  When  this  program RUNs, it displays a bouncing ball moving across the
screen  from  left  to  right  and  back  again. Take a close look at the
program to see how this is done.

  |  |  +---- 110 NEXT TM
  |  +------- 120 NEXT BL
  +---------- 130 GOTO 20

  Line  10  is  a  REMark  that tells you what the program does. A REMark
statement has no effect on the program itself.
  Line 20 clears the screen.
  Line  25  PRINTs ten cursor-down commands. This just positions the ball
in  the  middle  of  the  screen.  Without this line, the ball would move
across the top line of the screen.
  Line 30 sets up a loop to move the ball 40 columns from left to right.
  Line 40 does three things:

  1. PRINTs a space to erase the previous ball positions.
  2. PRINTs the ball.
  3. Performs  a  cursor-left  to  get  ready  to  erase the current ball
     position again.

  Line  50  and  60  set  up  a loop that slows down the ball's movement.
Without this loop, the ball would move too fast for you to see clearly.
  Line  70  completes  the  loop  set up in line 30 to PRINT balls on the
screen.  Each time the loop executes, the ball moves another space to the
right.  As you can see from the illustration, the program contains a loop
within  a  loop.  You can include up to ten loops within a loop. The only
time  you  get  in  trouble  is when the loops cross over each other. The
loops  have  to be NESTED inside each other. In other words, if you start
loop  A  and then start loop B inside loop A, you must finish loop B (the
inside loop) first. A maximum of nine loops may be nested in this way.
  When  you're  writing  a  program  with loops, it's a good idea to draw
arrows  from  the beginning to the end of the loops. If your loops cross,
the  computer  can't  figure  out what you want, so it can't execute your
program.
  Lines  80  through  120 just reverse the steps in the first part of the
program,  and  move  the  ball  from  right  to left. Line 90 is slightly
different  from  line  40  because  the  ball  is  moving in the opposite
direction,  and  you  have to erase the ball to the right and move to the
left.
  Line  130  sends the program back to line 20 to start the whole process
over again.
  For a variation on the program, change line 40 to read:

  40 PRINT &quot;(SHIFT-Q)&quot;

  Run  the  program  and  see  what happens now. Because you left out the
cursor control, each ball remains on the screen until it is erased by the
ball moving right to left in the second part of the program.


5.2. INPUT

  Up  to  now, everything in a program has been set up before the program
RUNs. Once you executed the program, you couldn't change or add anything.
The  INPUT  statement  lets you send information to a program WHILE it is
RUNning.  Not  only  does the program act on this information you supply,
but the program won't continue until you supply it.
  To get an idea of how INPUT works,  type NEW, press &lt;RETURN&gt;, and enter
this short program.

  10 INPUT A$
  20 PRINT &quot;YOU TYPED &quot;;A$
  30 PRINT
  40 IF A$ = &quot;STOP&quot; THEN END
  50 GOTO 10                                _________
  RUN                                      /         \
  ? GO  ----------------------------------| YOU TYPED |
  YOU TYPED GO                        /    \_________/
  ? CONTINUE  ----------------------/
  YOU TYPED CONTINUE              /
  ? STOP  ----------------------/
  YOU TYPED STOP

  Here's what happens in this program:

  Line  10 tells the computer to display a question mark to prompt you to
INPUT  a  value  for  A$,  and  to wait until you supply the value before
continuing the program execution.
  Line  20  PRINTs  a  message  and the INPUT value, and line 30 PRINTs a
blank line.
  Line  40 tells the computer to end the program immediately IF the value
you INPUT for A$ is STOP.
  Line  50 returns the program to line 10 so you can INPUT another value.
IF line 40 is true because the last value you INPUT for A$ was STOP, then
line 50 isn't executed.
  You  can  INPUT numeric or string variables, and you can have the INPUT
statement print a message along with a question mark to describe the kind
of  INPUT  the  computer is waiting for. For example, here's what happens
when you add a prompt message to line 10 of the previous example:

  10 INPUT &quot;KEEP GOING&quot;;A$      Prompt message can't be more than 38
  RUN                           characters
  KEEP GOING? GO
  YOU TYPED GO

  KEEP GOING? STOP
  YOU TYPED STOP

  Here's  a  more  complex example that demonstrates a lot of what's been
presented so far, including the INPUT statement.

  NEW
    1 REM TEMPERATURE CONVERSION PROGRAM
    5 PRINT &quot;(SHIFT-CLR/HOME)&quot;
   10 PRINT &quot;CONVERT FROM FAHRENHEIT OR CELSIUS (F/C): &quot;: INPUT A$
   20 IF A$ = &quot;&quot; THEN 10
   30 IF A$ = &quot;F&quot; THEN 100
   40 IF A$ &lt;&gt; &quot;C&quot; THEN 10
   50 INPUT &quot;ENTER DEGREES CELSIUS: &quot;;C
   60 F = (C*9)/5+32
   70 PRINT C;&quot; DEG. CELSIUS =&quot;; F ;&quot;DEG. FAHRENHEIT&quot;
   80 PRINT
   90 GOTO 10
  100 INPUT &quot;ENTER DEGREES FAHRENHEIT: &quot;;F
  110 C = (F-32)*5/9
  120 PRINT F;&quot; DEG. FAHRENHEIT =&quot;; C ;&quot;DEG. CELSIUS&quot;
  130 PRINT
  140 GOTO 10

  Line  10 uses the INPUT statement to print a prompt message and to wait
for you to type in a value for A$.
  Lines 20, 30 and 40 check what you typed in and tell the computer where
to  go next. Line 20 tells the computer to go back to line 10 and ask for
INPUT again IF nothing was typed in (IF just &lt;RETURN&gt; was pressed).  Line
30  tells  the  computer  to  go  straight  to  line  100 and perform the
Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion IF the value you typed for A$ is F.
  Line  40  checks  to  be sure that you haven't typed in anything beside
F or C.  IF you have,  line 40 ends the program. IF you typed in a C, the
computer  automatically  moves  to  line  50  to  perform the Celsius-to-
Fahrenheit conversion.

  It  may seem like too much detail to include all these IF statements to
check  what  you  INPUT. But this is a good programming practice that can
spare  you  a  lot  of frustration. You should always try to be sure that
your program takes care of all possibilities.
  Back to the example: once the program knows what type of conversion to
make, the calculations are made. Then the program PRINTs the temperature
you entered and the converted temperature.
  The  calculation this program performs is just straight math, using the
standard  formula  for  temperature  conversion.  After  the  calculation
finishes  and  the  answer  is PRINTed, the program loops back and starts
over.
  Here's a sample execution of this program:

  CONVERT FROM FAHRENHEIT OR CELSIUS (F/C): ? F
  ENTER DEGREES FAHRENHEIT: 32
  32 DEG. FAHRENHEIT = 0 DEG. CELSIUS

  CONVERT FROM FAHRENHEIT OR CELSIUS (F/C): ?

  After  you  RUN  this  program, you might want to save it on disk. This
program,  as well as others in this manual, can form part of your program
library.


5.3. USING THE GET STATEMENT FOR DATA INPUT

  GET  lets  you  input one character at a time from the keyboard without
pressing the  &lt;RETURN&gt;  key.  This really speeds up entering data in many
cases.
  When you RUN a program that has a GET statement, whatever key you press
is  assigned  to the variable you include in the GET statement. Here's an
example:

   1 PRINT &quot;(SHIFT-CLR/HOME)&quot;
  10 GET A$: IF A$ = &quot;&quot; THEN 10          No space between quotes
  20 PRINT A$;
  30 GOTO 10

  Line 1 clears the screen.
  Line  10  lets you type in any key on the keyboard. In effect, the loop
in  line  10  tells  the  computer to wait until you type in a key before
moving to line 20.
  Line 20 displays the keys you type on the screen.
  Line 30 sends the program back to GET another character. It's important
to  remember that the character you type in won't be displayed unless you
PRINT it to the screen, as we've done in line 20.
  The  IF  statement in line 10 is very important. GET continually works,
even  if  you  don't  press  a  key  (unlike  INPUT, which waits for your
response),  so the second part of line 10 continually checks the keyboard
until you hit a key.
  Try leaving out the second part of line 10 and see what happens.
  To stop this program, press the &lt;RUN/STOP&gt; and &lt;RESTORE&gt; keys.
  You  can  easily  rewrite  the  beginning of the temperature conversion
program  to  use GET instead of INPUT. If you've SAVEd this program, LOAD
it and change lines 10 and 20 like this:

  10 PRINT &quot;CONVERT FROM FAHRENHEIT OR CELSIUS (F/C)&quot;
  20 GET A$: IF A$ = &quot;&quot; THEN 20

  This  change  makes  the  program operate more smoothly because nothing
happens unless you type in one of the two responses (F or C) that selects
the  type of conversion. If you want to keep the program, be sure to SAVE
it again.


5.4. USING GET TO PROGRAM FUNCTION KEYS

  As  you'll recall from an earlier chapter, we told you that the keys on
the right side of the keyboard (F1 through F8) are function keys that you
can program to perform a variety of tasks.
  Here's how to program a function key:

1. Use a GET statement to read the keyboard.
2. Use  IF  statements  to compare the key you press to the CHR$ code for
   the function key you want to use.  Every character on the keyboard has
   a unique  CHR$  number.  For example,  the  CHR$ code of  F1  is  133.
   Appendix F lists the CHR$ code for all keys.
3. Use  THEN  statements  to tell the computer what you want the function
   key to do.

  When  you  RUN  the  program,  all  you  do is press a function key you
programmed,  and  the key will follow the instructions you gave it in the
THEN statement. For example:

  10 GET A$: IF A$ = &quot;&quot; THEN 10
  20 IF A$ = CHR$(137) THEN PRINT CHR$(14)
  30 IF A$ = CHR$(134) THEN PRINT &quot;YOURS TRULY&quot;

  Line  10  tells the program to assign the key you press to the variable
A$.  As  you'll  recall  from  the  previous example, the loop in line 10
continually checks the keyboard for input.
  Line  20 programs function key 2, CHR$(137). Line 20 tells the computer
to make A$ equal to CHR$(14) if you press function key 2. CHR$(14) is the
switch  from  upper  to  lower case letters on the keyboard. When you RUN
this  program,  you'll  see that the characters on the screen immediately
make this switch if you press F2.
  Line  30 programs function key 3, CHR$(134). Line 30 tells the computer
to  make A$ equal to the character string YOURS TRULY and CHR$(13) if you
press F3 during  program execution. CHR$(13) is the code for the &lt;RETURN&gt;
key.
  THE CHR$ codes for the function keys are:

  F1 = CHR$(133)      F2 = CHR$(137)
  F3 = CHR$(134)      F4 = CHR$(138)
  F5 = CHR$(135)      F6 = CHR$(139)
  F7 = CHR$(136)      F8 = CHR$(140)

  The  COMMODORE  64  PROGRAMMER'S  REFERENCE  GUIDE has more information
about  programming  function  keys. You can purchase this extensive guide
from your local Commodore dealer.


5.5. RANDOM NUMBERS AND OTHER FUNCTIONS

  The  64 also has built-in functions that you can use to perform special
tasks.  Functions are like built-in programs included in BASIC. The great
advantage of these built-in functions is that you don't have to type in a
number  of  statements  every  time  you  want  to  perform a specialized
calculation. Instead, all you do is type the command for the function you
want and the computer does all the rest.
  These  built-in  functions include figuring square roots (SQR), finding
out  the  contents of a memory location (PEEK), generating random numbers
(RND),  etc.  Appendix  C  lists  all  the  functions  available  on your
computer.
  One  function  you  can  have  a  lot  of fun with is the random number
function,  RND.  If  you want to design a game or an educational program,
you'll  often  need to be able to program your computer to make up random
numbers.  For  example,  you'd need to do this to simulate the tossing of
dice.  Of  course  you  could  write  a program that would generate these
random  numbers,  but  it's  much  easier  to  be able to do this just by
calling upon the prewritten RaNDom number function.
  To see how RND works, try this short program:

  NEW
  10 FOR X = 1 TO 10
  20 PRINT RND(1),           IF YOU LEAVE OUT THE COMMA, YOUR
  30 NEXT                    LIST OF NUMBERS APPEARS AS 1 COLUMN

  When you RUN this program, the screen displays:

   .789280697          .664673958
   .256373663          .0123442287
   .682952381          3.90587279E-04
   .402343724          .879300926
   .158209063          .245596701

  Your  numbers  don't  match? It would be incredible if they did because
the program generates a completely random list of ten numbers.
  If  you  RUN  the program a few more times, you'll see that the results
are  always  different.  Though  the numbers don't have a pattern, you'll
notice a few consistencies about the list the program displays.
  For  one thing, the results are always between 1 and 0, but never equal
to  1  or  0.  For  another,  the  numbers are real numbers (with decimal
points).
  Now,  we started out to simulate dice tosses, and the results from this
program  aren't  exactly what we're looking for. Now we'll add a few more
features to this program to get what we want.
  First,  add  this  line  to the program to replace line 20, and RUN the
program again:

  20 PRINT 6*RND(1),
  RUN

   3.60563664       4.52687513
   5.48602315       1.09650123
   3.10045018       4.39052168
   3.91302584       5.06321506
   2.32056144       4.10781302

  Now  we've  got  results larger than 1, but still have real numbers. To
solve this, we'll use another function.
  The  INT  function converts real numbers to integer (whole) numbers. So
try replacing line 20 again:

  20 PRINT INT(6*RND(1),
  RUN

   2         3         1         0
   2         4         5         5
   0         1

  Now  we're  even closer to our goal, but you'll notice that the numbers
range from 0 to 5, not 1 to 6.  So as a final step, we'll replace line 20
again:

  20 PRINT INT(6*RND(1))+1

  Now when you RUN the program, you'll get the results you want.
  When  you  want  to  generate  a range of real numbers instead of whole
numbers,  the formula is slightly different because you must subtract the
lower  limit  of  the  range  from  the upper limit. For example, you can
generate random numbers between 1 and 25 by typing:

  20 PRINT RND(1)*(25-1)+1

  The  general  formula  for generating random numbers in a certain range
is:

  NUMBER = RND(1) * (UPPER LIMIT - LOWER LIMIT) + LOWER LIMIT


5.6. GUESSING GAME

  Here's a game that uses random numbers. This game not only uses the RND
function, but it also introduces some additional programming theory.
  When you RUN this program, the computer generates a random number, NM,
whose value you'll try to guess in as few turns as possible.
                                                         ______________
  NEW                                                   /              \
    1 REM NUMBER GUESSING GAME              ___________| INDICATES NO   |
    2 PRINT &quot;(CLR/HOME)&quot;                   /           | SPACE AFTER    |
    5 INPUT &quot;ENTER UPPER LIMIT FOR GUESS &quot;; LI         | QUOTATION MARK |
   10 NM = INT(LI*RND(1))+1                             \______________/
   15 CN = 0
   20 PRINT &quot;I'VE GOT THE NUMBER.&quot;: PRINT
   30 INPUT &quot;WHAT'S YOUR GUESS &quot;; GU
   35 CN = CN + 1
   40 IF GU &gt; NM THEN PRINT &quot;MY NUMBER IS LOWER.&quot; : PRINT : GOTO 30
   50 IF GU &lt; NM THEN PRINT &quot;MY NUMBER IS HIGHER.&quot;: PRINT : GOTO 30
   60 IF GU = NM THEN PRINT &quot;GREAT! YOU GOT MY NUMBER&quot;
   65 PRINT &quot;IN ONLY&quot;; CN ;&quot;GUESSES.&quot; : PRINT
   70 PRINT &quot;DO YOU WANT TO TRY ANOTHER (Y/N)?&quot;
   80 GET AN$ : IF AN$ = &quot;&quot; THEN 80
   90 IF AN$ = &quot;Y&quot; THEN 2
  100 IF AN$ &lt;&gt; &quot;N&quot; THEN 70
  110 END

  You  can  specify  how  large  the  number  will be at the start of the
program. Then, it's up to you to guess what the number is.
  A sample run follows along with an explanation.

  ENTER UPPER LIMIT FOR GUESS? 25
  I'VE GOT THE NUMBER.

  WHAT'S YOUR GUESS ? 15
  MY NUMBER IS HIGHER.

  WHAT'S YOUR GUESS ? 20
  MY NUMBER IS LOWER.

  WHAT'S YOUR GUESS ? 19
  GREAT! YOU GOT MY NUMBER
  IN ONLY 3 GUESSES.

  DO YOU WANT TO TRY ANOTHER (Y/N)?

  The  IF/THEN  statement  (lines 40-60) compare your guess to the random
number  (NM)  generated  by  line 10. If your guess is wrong, the program
tells you whether your guess is higher or lower than NM.
  Each time you make a guess, line 35 adds 1 to CN.  CN is a counter that
keeps  track  of  how  many guesses you take to get the right number. The
purpose of this game,  of course,  is to guess the number in as few tries
as possible.
  When you get the right answer, the program displays the message, GREAT!
YOU GOT MY NUMBER, and tells you how many guesses you took.
  Remember  that  the  program  creates a new random number each time you
play the game.
  You  might want to add a few lines to the program that also specify the
lower range of numbers generated by this game.

5.7. YOUR ROLL

  The  following  program  simulates the throw of two dice.  You can play
this little game by itself, or use it as part of a larger game.

   5 PRINT &quot;CARE TO TRY YOUR LUCK?&quot;
  10 PRINT &quot;RED DICE = &quot;; INT(RND(1)*6)+1
  20 PRINT &quot;WHITE DICE = &quot;; INT(RND(1)*6)+1
  30 PRINT &quot;PRESS SPACE BAR FOR ANOTHER ROLL&quot;: PRINT
  40 GET A$: IF A$ = &quot;&quot; THEN 40
  50 IF A$ = CHR$(32) THEN 10

  From what you've learned about BASIC and random numbers, see if you can
follow  what's  going  on  in  this  program.  As you may recall from the
section  on  programming  the  function  keys,  CHR$(32) is the character
string code for the space bar.


5.8. RANDOM GRAPHICS

  As  a final note on random numbers, and as an introduction to designing
graphics, try entering and RUNning this program:

  10 PRINT &quot;(SHIFT-CLR/HOME)&quot;
  20 PRINT CHR$(205.5 + RND(1));
  30 GOTO 20

  The  function CHR$ (CHaracter String) gives you a character, based on a
standard  code number from 0 to 255.  Every character the 64 can print is
encoded this way. Appendix F lists the CHR$ codes for all keys.
  A  quick  way  of  finding out the code for any character is to use the
function ASC (for the standard ASCII code). Type:

  PRINT ASC(&quot;X&quot;)

X  is  the  character  you're checking. X can be any printable character,
including   graphics  characters.  You  must  enclose  the  character  in
quotation marks. Here's an example:

  PRINT ASC(&quot;G&quot;)
  71

The CHR$ function is the opposite of ASC.

  PRINT CHR$(71)
  G

If you type:

  PRINT CHR$(205);CHR$(206)

the  computer  displays  the two right side graphics on the M and N keys,
which are the characters used in the little maze program you just tried.
  The  formula  205.5 + RND(1) tells the computer to pick a random number
between  205.5  and  206.5.  There  is fifty-fifty chance that the random
number  will  be  above  or below 206. CHR$ ignores fractional values, so
half the time the character with code 205 is printed, and the rest of the
time code 206 is displayed.
  You  can experiment with this program by adding or subtracting a couple
of  tenths  from  205.5.  This gives either character a greater chance of
being displayed.



6. COLOR AND GRAPHICS


6.1. HOW TO USE COLOR AND GRAPHICS ON YOUR COMPUTER

  So  far  this  book  has  presented some of the sophisticated computing
capabilities of  your  64.  But one of the most exciting features of your
new  computer  is  its outstanding ability to produce 16 different colors
and a lot of different graphics.
  You've  already seen a very simple demonstration of the graphics in the
bouncing  ball  program  and  in  the maze program at the end of the last
chapter. This chapter introduces you to new concepts that explain graphic
and color programming, and that suggest ideas for creating your own games
and advanced animation.


6.2. PRINTING COLORS

  When  you  tried  the color alignment test in Chapter 1, you discovered
that you can change text colors by simply holding down the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and
pressing one of the color keys.
  The  64  offers a full range of 16 colors. Though only eight colors are
printed  on  the  color keys,  you can get eight more by holding down the
&lt;C=&gt; key and pressing a color key. Here's a list of the colors:

   KEYBOARD     COLOR     DISPLAY       KEYBOARD     COLOR     DISPLAY
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;1&gt;    BLACK                   &lt;C=&gt; &lt;1&gt;    ORANGE
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;2&gt;    WHITE                   &lt;C=&gt; &lt;2&gt;    BROWN
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;3&gt;    RED                     &lt;C=&gt; &lt;3&gt;    LT. RED
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;4&gt;    CYAN                    &lt;C=&gt; &lt;4&gt;    GRAY 1
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;5&gt;    PURPLE                  &lt;C=&gt; &lt;5&gt;    GRAY 2
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;6&gt;    GREEN                   &lt;C=&gt; &lt;6&gt;    LT. GREEN
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;7&gt;    BLUE                    &lt;C=&gt; &lt;7&gt;    LT. BLUE
  &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;8&gt;    YELLOW                  &lt;C=&gt; &lt;8&gt;    GRAY 3

  When  we  showed you the bouncing ball program in the last chapter, you
saw that keyboard commands,  such as cursor movement, can be written into
PRINT statements.  In the same way you can also add text color changes to
your programs.

  Type  NEW  and  try  experimenting with changing colors.  Hold down the
&lt;CTRL&gt; key and at the same time press the &lt;1&gt; key.  Now release both keys
and  press the &lt;R&gt; key.  Now hold down the &lt;CTRL&gt; key again and press the
&lt;2&gt;  key.  Release the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and type the &lt;A&gt; key.  Move through the
numbers, alternating with the letters, and type out the word RAINBOW like
this:

  10 PRINT &quot; R A I N B O W&quot;
            ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
     &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7&gt;

  You'll  recall that cursor controls appear as graphic characters in the
PRINT   statement.   Color  controls  are  also  represented  as  graphic
characters.  The  color  chart printed above shows the graphic characters
that  appear with each color.  Because of the graphic characters that are
displayed  when  you  select  color keys,  your PRINT statement will look
strange,  but when you RUN the program,  you'll see that only the text of
the message is displayed. The letters in the message automatically change
colors according to the color controls you placed in the PRINT statement.
  Now  try  making  up  some  examples of your own,  mixing any number of
colors  within  a single PRINT statement.  Don't forget the second set of
colors  that  you  can get by holding down the &lt;C=&gt; key while you press a
color key.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIP:                                                                  |
|   After  you  RUN  a  program  with  color or mode (reverse) changes, |
| you'll notice that the  READY  prompt and any additional text you key |
| in is the same as the last color or mode change you made. To get back |
| to the normal display, press these keys together:                     |
|                                                  RUN/STOP and RESTORE |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


6.3. COLOR CHR$ CODES

  Before you start reading this section, take a look at Appendix F, which
lists the CHR$ codes for all keys on the keyboard.
  As  you  looked  over the list of CHR$ codes, you probably noticed that
each  color  has  a  unique  code,  just  like all the other keys and the
keyboard  controls.  If  you print the codes themselves by using the CHR$
function mentioned in the last chapter,  you can get the same results you
got by typing &lt;CTRL&gt; or &lt;C=&gt; and the color key in a PRINT statement.
  For example, try this:

  NEW
  10 PRINT CHR$(147): REM &lt;CLR/HOME&gt;
  20 PRINT CHR$(28);&quot;CHR$(28) CHANGES ME TO?&quot;

  RUN
  CHR$(28) CHANGES ME TO?

  When you RUN this program, the screen clears before the message in line
20 is PRINTed. The text should be red now.
  In  many  cases,  you'll  find  that  it's  much easier to use the CHR$
function to change colors, especially if you want to experiment. The next
page  shows another way to get a rainbow of colors. There are a number of
similar lines in the program (40 through 110), so use the editing keys to
spare  yourself a lot of typing.  See the notes at the end of the program
listing to refresh your memory on editing procedures.

  NEW

    1 REM AUTOMATIC COLOR BARS
    5 PRINT CHR$(147): REM CHR$(147) = CLR/HOME
   10 PRINT CHR$(18); &quot;     &quot;;: REM REVERSE BAR
   20 CL = INT(8*RND(1))+1
   30 ON CL GOTO 40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110
   40 PRINT CHR$(5);: GOTO 10
   50 PRINT CHR$(28);: GOTO 10
   60 PRINT CHR$(30);: GOTO 10
   70 PRINT CHR$(31);: GOTO 10
   80 PRINT CHR$(144);: GOTO 10
   90 PRINT CHR$(156);: GOTO 10
  100 PRINT CHR$(158);: GOTO 10
  110 PRINT CHR$(159);: GOTO 10

  Type lines 1 through 40 normally. Your display should look like this:

   1 REM AUTOMATIC COLOR BARS
   5 PRINT CHR$(147): REM CHR$(147) = CLR/HOME
  10 PRINT CHR$(18); &quot;     &quot;;: REM REVERSE BAR
  20 CL = INT(8*RND(1))+1
  30 ON CL GOTO 40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110
  40 PRINT CHR$(5);: GOTO 10
  _

EDITING NOTES:

  Use the  &lt;CRSR-UP&gt;  key to position the cursor on line 40.  Then type 5
over  the 4 of 40.  Now use the &lt;CRSR-RIGHT&gt; key to move over to the 5 in
the  CHR$  parentheses.  Press &lt;SHIFT&gt; and &lt;INST/DEL&gt; to open up a space,
and  key  in  28. Now just press &lt;RETURN&gt; with the cursor anywhere on the
line. The display should look like this now:

NEW

   1 REM AUTOMATIC COLOR BARS
   5 PRINT CHR$(147): REM CHR$(147) = CLR/HOME
  10 PRINT CHR$(18); &quot;     &quot;;: REM REVERSE BAR
  20 CL = INT(8*RND(1))+1
  30 ON CL GOTO 40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110
  50 PRINT CHR$(28);: GOTO 10

  Don't worry about line 40;  it's still there, as you can see by LISTing
the  program.  Follow  the  same  steps to modify line 40 with a new line
number  and CHR$ code until you've entered all the remaining lines.  As a
final check, LIST the entire program to make sure all the lines are right
before you RUN it.
  You  probably  understand  the  color  bar  program except for line 30.
Here's a brief explanation of how this program works.
  Line 5 prints the CHR$ code for &lt;CLR/HOME&gt;.
  Line 10 turns on reverse type and prints 5 spaces, which turn out to be
a bar since they're reversed. The first time through the program, the bar
is light blue, the normal screen display color.
  Line  20 uses the random function to select at random a color between 1
and 8.
  Line  30  uses  a  variation of the IF/THEN statement,  called ON/GOTO,
which  lets  the  program  choose  from as list of line numbers where the
program will go next. If the ON variable (in this case CL) has a value of
1,  the program goes to the first line number listed (here it's line 40).
If  the  variable  has a value of 2,  the program goes to the second line
listed, and so on.
  Lines  40  through  110  just  convert  the  random  key  colors to the
appropriate CHR$ code for that color and return the program to line 10 to
PRINT  a  section of the bar in that color. Then the whole process starts
again.
  See  if  you  can  figure  out how to produce 16 random colors.  Expand
ON/GOTO to handle the additional colors and add the remaining CHR$ codes.


6.4. HOW TO USE PEEKS AND POKES

  PEEKS and POKES let you search around inside your computer's memory and
stick things in exactly where you want them.
  You'll  recall  that  in Chapter 4 we explained variables as being like
little  slots  in  the  computer's memory,  with the variable name as the
slot's  address.  Well,  imagine some more specially defined slots in the
computer  that  stand for specific memory locations and that have numbers
for addresses.
  Your  64  looks  at  these  memory  locations  to see what the screen's
background and border colors should be, what characters to display on the
screen and where to display them, etc.
  You  can  change  the  screen colors, define and move objects, and even
create music by POKEing a different value into the specific memory slots.
  Imagine some memory slots looking something like this:

  +-----------+     +-----------+      +-----------+      +-----------+
  |   53280   |     |   53281   |      |   53282   |      |   53283   |
  |     2     |     |     1     |      |           |      |           |
  +-----------+     +-----------+      +-----------+      +-----------+

     BORDER          BACKGROUND
     COLOR             COLOR

  The  first  two  slots  are  the  memory  locations  for the border and
background  colors on your screen.  We've put 2, the value for RED in the
border color box, and 1, the value for WHITE in the background color box.
Now try typing this:

  POKE 53281,7 &lt;RETURN&gt;

  The  background  color  of your screen will change to yellow because we
put  the  value 7,  for yellow,  in the location that controls background
color.
  Try POKEing different values into the background color location and see
what  result you get.  Here's a list of the values to POKE for each color
available on your 64:

  0   BLACK            8    ORANGE
  1   WHITE            9    BROWN
  2   RED             10    light RED
  3   CYAN            11    GRAY 1
  4   PURPLE          12    GRAY 2
  5   GREEN           13    light GREEN
  6   BLUE            14    light BLUE
  7   YELLOW          15    GRAY 3

  Here's  a little program that you can use to display various border and
background color combinations:

  NEW

  10 FOR BA = 0 TO 15
  20 FOR BO = 0 TO 15
  30 POKE 53280, BO
  40 POKE 53281, BA
  50 FOR X = 1 TO 2000: NEXT X
  60 NEXT BO : NEXT BA

  RUN

  This program uses two simple loops to POKE various values to change the
background and border colors.  Line 50 contains a DELAY loop,  which just
slows the program down a little bit.
  If  you're curious about what value is currently in the memory location
for background color, try this:

  ? PEEK (53280) AND 15

  PEEK looks at a whole byte,  but colors only use half a byte,  called a
nybble. To PEEK just this nybble, you have to add the AND 15 to your PEEK
statement.  If  you  used  this  PEEK after RUNning the previous program,
you'd  get  15 as the answer because the last border color POKEd was GRAY
3, which is 15.
  In  general,  PEEK  lets  you see what value is currently in a specific
memory  slot.  Try adding this line to your program to display the values
of BORDER and BACKGROUND as the program RUNs.

  25 PRINT CHR$(147); &quot;BORDER = &quot;; PEEK(53280) AND 15,
     &quot;BACKGROUND = &quot;; PEEK(53281) AND 15


6.5. SCREEN GRAPHICS

  So  far  when you've PRINTed information,  the computer has handled the
information sequentially:  one character PRINTed after the next, starting
from  the current cursor position,  except when you asked for a new line,
or used a comma in PRINT formatting.
  You can PRINT data in a particular place by starting from a known place
on  the  screen  and  PRINTing  the  correct number of cursor controls to
format the display. But this takes time and program steps.
  But  just  as  there  certain  locations  in the 64's memory to control
color, there are also memory locations that you can use to control screen
locations.


6.6. SCREEN MEMORY MAP

  The  64's  screen can hold 1000 characters (40 columns by 25 lines), so
there  are  1000  memory  locations set aside to represent what is on the
screen. Imagine the screen as a grid, 40 by 25, with each square standing
for one memory location.
  Each  memory  location  can contain one of the 256 different characters
the  64  can  display  (see Appendix E).  Each of these 256 characters is
represented  by  a  number from  0  to  255.  If you POKE the value for a
character into a specific screen memory location,  that character will be
displayed in that specific screen location.
  Here's a grid that represents your screen, complete with the numbers of
each screen memory location.

                                 COLUMN                             1063
      0             10             20             30            39 /

     +------------------------------------------------------------\
                                                                   \
                                                                    2023

  The 64's screen memory normally begins at memory location 1024 and ends
at  location 2023.  Location 1024 is the upper left corner of the screen.
Location 1025 is the position of the next character to the right,  and so
on.  Location 1063 is the right-most position of the first row. Following
the last character in a row, the next location is the left-most character
on the next row down.
  Suppose you want to control a ball bouncing on the screen.  The ball is
in  the  middle  of  the  screen,  column  29,  row  12.  The formula for
calculating the memory location on the screen is:

  POINT = 1024 + X + 40 * Y &lt;---- row
                 ^--------- column

where X is the column and Y is the row.
  Therefore, the memory location of the ball is:

  POINT = 1024 + 20 + 480 &lt;-- row (40x12)
  POINT = 1524   ^------- column

  Clear the screen with &lt;SHIFT&gt; and &lt;CLR/HOME&gt; and type:

  POKE 1524,81 &lt;--- character code
         ^------ location

  This  POKE  statement  makes a ball appear in the middle of the screen.
You have placed a character directly into screen memory without using the
PRINT  statement.  However,  you  can't see the ball yet because it's the
same color as the screen background.


6.7. COLOR MEMORY MAP

  You  can change the color of the ball that appeared by altering another
range of memory. Type:

  POKE 55796,2 &lt;--- color
         ^---- location

  This changes the ball's color to red.
  Every  spot  on  the  64's screen has TWO memory locations: one for the
character code,  and one for the color code.  The color memory map begins
at  location  55296  (upper  left  corner),  and  continues  on  for 1000
locations.  You use the same color codes, 0 through 15,  that you used to
change border and background colors, to directly change character color.
  We  can  modify  the formula for calculating screen memory locations to
give us the locations to POKE colors. Here's the new formula:

  COLOR PRINT = 55296 + X + 40 * Y &lt;--- row
                        ^--------- column


6.8. MORE BOUNCING BALLS

  Here's  a  revised  bouncing  ball  program that directly prints on the
screen  using  POKEs rather than cursor controls within PRINT statements.
When  you RUN this version,  you'll see that it's much more flexible than
the  earlier  program  and  it leads up to programming more sophisticated
animation.

   NEW

   10 POKE 53281,1: PRINT&quot;&lt;CTRL/WHITE&gt;&lt;SHIFT CLR/HOME&gt;&quot;
   20 POKE 53280,7: POKE 53281,6
   30 X = 1 : Y = 1
   40 DX = 1 : DY = 1
   50 POKE 1024 + X + 40 * Y, 81
   60 FOR T = 1 TO 10 : NEXT
   70 POKE 1024 + X + 40 * Y, 32
   80 X = X + DX
   90 IF X &lt;= 0 OR X &gt;= 39 THEN DX = -DX
  100 Y = Y + DY
  110 IF Y &lt;= 0 OR Y &gt;= 24 THEN DY = -DY
  120 GOTO 50

  Line  10  sets  the  cursor  color to white and then clears the screen.
NOTE:  Clearing  the screen on (NTSC) 64s sets the color RAM to white but
on  (PAL)  64s the color RAM is set to the current background color (here
white).
  Line  20  sets  the  background  color  to blue and the border color to
yellow.
  The  X  and Y variables in line 30 keep track of the ball's current row
and  column  position.  The  DX  and  DY  variables  in  line  40 are the
horizontal  and  vertical direction of the ball's movement.  When a +1 is
added to the value of X,  the ball moves to the right;  when -1 is added,
the  ball  moves to the left.  A +1 added to Y moves the ball down a row,
and a -1 added to Y moves the ball up a row.
  Line  50 puts the ball on the screen at the current X,Y position.  Line
60 is a delay loop, which is included to keep the ball on the screen long
enough for you to be able to see it.
  Line 70 erases the ball by putting a space (code 32) where the ball was
on the screen.
  Line 80 adds the direction factor to X.
  Line 90 tests to see if the ball has reached one of the side walls, and
reverses  the ball's direction if there's a bounce.  Lines 100 and 110 do
the same thing for the top and bottom walls.
  Line 120 sends the ball back to display and moves the ball again.
  You  can change the ball to any other character by changing the code in
line 50 from 81 to another character code.
  If  you  change  DX  or  DY  to  0 the ball bounces straight instead of
diagonally.
  We  can also add a little intelligence to the bouncing ball program. So
far  the  only  thing you checked for is whether the ball is going out of
bounds on the screen. Try adding the following lines to the program:

   21 FOR L = 1 TO 10
   25 POKE 1024 + INT(RND(1)*1000), 160  &lt;---(REVERSE SPACE)
   27 NEXT L
  115 IF PEEK(1024 + X + 40*Y) = 166 THEN DX = -DX : GOTO 80

  Lines  21  to 27 put ten blocks on the screen in random positions. Line
115 PEEKs to see if the ball is about to bounce into a block, and, if so,
it changes the ball's direction.



7. INTRODUCTION TO SPRITES


  In  previous  chapters,  we've  shown you how to use graphic symbols in
PRINT statements to create animation and other visual effects.
  In  chapter  6,  we  also  showed  you  how  to POKE character codes in
specific  screen  memory locations,  which put characters directly on the
screen in the place you selected.
  In  both  of  these  cases,  you  have  to create objects from existing
graphic  symbols,  so these methods take a lot of work.  When you want to
move  the  object,  you  must  use a number of program statements to keep
track  of the object and move it to a new place.  And sometimes the shape
and resolution of the object isn't as good as you'd like it to be because
of the limitations of using graphic symbols.
  You  can eliminate a lot of these problems by using sprites in animated
sequences. A sprite is a high-resolution programmable object that you can
make  into just about any shape by using BASIC commands.  All you have to
do  to  move  the  object  is simply tell the computer the position where
you'd like the sprite to go. The computer takes care of the rest.
  But this isn't all you can do with sprites. For example, you can change
their  color,  you can tell if one object collides with another,  you can
make  them  go in front and behind each other,  and you can easily expand
their size.
  You  have  to  learn  a  few  more details about your 64 and the way it
handles  numbers before you can use sprites.  It's not difficult, though,
so  just  follow  the  examples  and you'll be making your own sprites do
amazing things in no time.


7.1. BITS AND BYTES

  Before  you  can  use  sprites it's important that you understand a few
general things about how computers work.
  In the decimal system,  we count in &quot;tens&quot; using values of 0-9.  When a
particular  position  overflows  its  maximum value of 9, it re-cycles to
zero  and  carries one to the next (left-hand) position. For example, the
number  64  means  6 x (10) + 4 x (1).  The  position  of  each  digit is
important. The value of 64 is calculated as follows:

                        6 x 10^1 + 4 x 10^0

NOTE: Any number raised to the power of zero equals 1.

  Computers   store  information  as  a  series  of  electrical  charges,
representing 1s and 0s.  Each cell within memory holds a pattern of eight
ones  and  zeros called  binary digits  or  BITS.  These cells are called
BYTES.  A bit, which is the smallest amount of information a computer can
store,  can  be  turned  ON,  giving it a value of 1, or OFF, which has a
value of 0.
  When  you  enter  information  into  the computer via the keyboard, key
depressions  are  converted  into  8  bit patterns of ones and zeros, and
transferred to memory.
  The  rules  for  binary  arithmetic are much simpler than other systems
since  digits  can  only have two values,  0 or 1.  As illustrated in the
previous  example,  the  decimal system uses the base of 10,  whereas the
binary system uses the base of 2.
  One  bit  can contain one of two combinations,  0 or 1.  There are four
possible combinations of 1s and 0s in two bits (2^2) and with three bits,
eight  possible combinations (2^3).  The following illustration shows the
range of values.

+---------+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
| NO. OF  |    NO. OF    |                                              |
| BITS    |    VALUES    | POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS                        |
+---------+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
| 1       |     2^1      | ON                          1                |
|         |     = 2      | OFF                         0                |
+---------+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
| 2       |     2^2      | ON  and  ON                 1 1              |
|         |     = 4      | ON  and OFF                 1 0              |
|         |              | OFF and  ON                 0 1              |
|         |              | OFF and OFF                 0 0              |
+---------+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
| 3       |     2^3      | ON  and  ON and  ON         1 1 1            |
|         |     = 8      | ON  and  ON and OFF         1 1 0            |
|         |              | ON  and OFF and  ON         1 0 1            |
|         |              | ON  and OFF and OFF         1 0 0            |
|         |              | OFF and  ON and  ON         0 1 1            |
|         |              | OFF and OFF and  ON         0 0 1            |
|         |              | OFF and  ON and OFF         0 1 0            |
|         |              | OFF and OFF and OFF         0 0 0            |
+---------+--------------+----------------------------------------------+

  As you can see,  the number of combinations is 2 raised to the power of
the  number  of  bits.  For  one BYTE,  or eight bits,  you can store 256
different values i.e. 2^8.
  When  all  eight bits are OFF, i.e. set to 0, the byte contains a value
of zero.  When all eight bits are ON, i.e. set to 1, the byte has a value
of 255. Note that the combinations range from 0 to 255 inclusive.
  You  may  convert any binary number to a decimal value simply by adding
those  powers  of  two  where  a  bit  has  been  set.  The example below
illustrates how a decimal value of 181 is held in binary form:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BINARY POSITIONS          2^7   2^6   2^5   2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 DECIMAL EQUIVALENT        128    64    32    16     8     4     2     1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BIT VALUES                  1     0     1     1     0     1     0     1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Adding up the values of the ON bits gives:

    2^7  +  2^5  +  2^4  +  2^2  +  2^0

or  128  +   32  +   16  +   4   +   1   =   181

  The  following is a table showing binary to decimal conversion.  A zero
indicates  that  the  bit  is  OFF,  and  a 1 shows that a bit is ON.  To
calculate the value of the entire byte,  add the decimal value of each ON
bit.

7.2. CREATING A SPRITE

Sprite Registers

  Before  going  any  further you need to know a little about how sprites
are manipulated by the COMMODORE 64.
  Sprites are handled by a special chip inside your COMMODORE 64. This is
called  the  VIC  II  chip.  This chip contains a series of special bytes
called  REGISTERS  which  are  provided specifically for sprite handling.
Each  register  performs  a  separate function.  For example,  the ENABLE
REGISTER  controls  whether  a  sprite  is  active or inactive, while the
EXPAND  REGISTERS  control  the  size  of  a  sprite.  When you work with
sprites,  think  of  a  register as a byte with a specific function.  The
registers we will be talking about in this chapter are listed below:

  REGISTER No.     DESCRIPTION
  ------------------------------------
     0-15          SPRITE POSITIONING
       16          EXTRA MOVEMENT
       21          ENABLE (ON/OFF)
       23          EXPAND (VERTICAL)
       27          PRIORITIES
       28          MULTI-COLOR SELECT
       29          EXPAND (HORIZONTAL)
    37-38          MULTI-COLORS
    39-46          COLOR

  Each  of  these  registers,  or  bytes,  have  been assigned a specific
location  in  the  memory of the computer.  They start at location 53248.
This  is  the  'base  address'  of the VIC II chip.  To access individual
registers,  it is easier to assign a variable with the value of the start
address  and  then  add  the  register number to it,  e.g.  V=53248: POKE
V+21,255. This will put the value of 255 into register 21.
  The  VIC II chip in your COMMODORE 64 does all the work of creating and
keeping  track  of  characters  and graphics,  creating colors and moving
sprites around.  All you have to do is to tell the computer the following
three details about the sprite:

  What it should look like
  What color it should be
  Where it should appear

  The VIC II chip contains 46 registers and controls up to 8 sprites at a
time.  You  can  design,  create  and  move  your  sprite  by POKEing the
appropriate decimal value in the particular memory location.


7.3. DESIGNING A SPRITE

  A sprite is made up of 504 dots. These are arranged in a 24 dot wide by
21 dot deep grid. As we mentioned earlier, you can use up to 8 sprites at
a  time,  numbered  from 0 to 7.  Each dot on the sprite corresponds to a
bit.  In order to design a sprite, you simply set the relevant bit on the
grid.  Each  line on the grid contains 24 bits (three bytes). Each sprite
takes up 64 bytes in memory, i.e. 21 multiplied by 3 plus one spare byte.
(For  the  more  technically minded, the number 64 is much easier for the
VIC II chip to work with  because it is a power of 2 and therefore easier
to multiply.)
  Because you can visualize a sprite inside a grid, the design process is
greatly  simplified.  Suppose  you  want  to create a balloon and make it
float around the screen. The grid on page 78 shows its shape. You can set
up  your own grid preferably using lined,  or better still,  graph paper.
Draw a grid that is 21 squares high and 24 squares across.  Divide the 24
squares across into 3 sections of 8 spaces.
  The  next  step is to convert the graphic design into data the computer
can  use.  Number  the  8  squares in each of the three sections 128, 64,
32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1. These values are equivalent to 2^7, 2^6, 2^5, 2^4,
2^3, 2^2, 2^1 and 2^0.
  Number  the  squares  down the left hand side of the page from 1-21 for
each  row.  Now fill in the grid with any design, or use the balloon that
we've  drawn.  It's  easier  to outline the shape first, then go back and
fill in the grid.
  Think  of the squares you have filled in as ON bits, and substitute a 1
for  each  filled square.  Think of the squares that aren't filled as OFF
bits, and give them a value of zero.
  Now  look  along  row  1  and think of each 8 square section as a byte.
Convert  each  section  of 8 bits into a decimal value.  You can even use
your Binary to Decimal converter program if you wish. Now convert each of
the 21 rows into 3 decimal values, giving 63 values in all.

                                   1    1    2   2
                          1   5    0    5    0   4

                                   COLUMN

  Now look at the design of the balloon. The first series of 8 squares on
the  first  row  are  all blank,  therefore the bits are all OFF giving a
value of zero. The middle series on row 1 looks like this:

  00000000  01111111  00000000

  The  third  series  of  8  squares  on the first row also contains only
blanks so it also equals zero. So the data for the first line is:

  DATA 0, 127, 0

  The three series of dots that make up row two are calculated like this:

            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  Series 1: |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                                                         1  =  1

            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  Series 2: |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
               ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^
               |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
              128 +  64 +  32 +  16 +  8  +  4  +  2  +  1  =  255

            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  Series 3: |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
               ^     ^
               |     |
              128 +  64                                     =  192

  The data for the second row is:

  DATA 1, 255, 192

  Use this method to convert the three series of 8 squares in each of the
remaining rows. Once you have completed these calculations, you are ready
to  write  a  BASIC program to use the balloon (or any other shape) since
the  sprite  has  now  been  converted  into  values  your  computer  can
understand.
  To demonstrate the use of sprites, type in the following program:

   1 REM UP, UP, AND AWAY
   5 PRINT &quot;(CLR/HOME)&quot;
  10 V = 53248 : REM START OF DISPLAY CHIP
  11 POKE V + 21,4 : REM ENABLE SPRITE 2
  12 POKE 2042,13 : REM SPRITE 2 DATA FROM BLOCK 13
  20 FOR N = 0 TO 62 : READ Q : POKE 832+N,Q : NEXT   +----------------+
  30 FOR X = 0 TO 200        ^------------------------| GETS ITS INFO. |
  40 POKE V + 4,X : REM UPDATE X COORDINATES          | FROM DATA      |
  50 POKE V + 5,X : REM UPDATE Y COORDINATES          +----------------+
  60 NEXT X
  70 GOTO 30
 200 DATA 0,127,0,1,255,192,3,255,224,3,231,224    \   +---------------+
 210 DATA 7,217,240,7,223,240,7,217,240,3,231,224   |--| INFO. READ IN |
 220 DATA 3,255,224,3,255,224,2,255,160,1,127,64    |  | FROM Q        |
 230 DATA 1,62,64,0,156,128,0,156,128,0,73,0,0,73,0 |  +---------------+
 240 DATA 0,62,0,0,62,0,0,62,0,0,28,0              /

  If you have entered everything correctly, when you type &quot;RUN&quot; and press
&lt;RETURN&gt;, your balloon should sail across the screen.  At this stage, you
will not understand the meaning of much of the program but, as we explain
each stage of sprite handling, we will use the program to illustrate each
feature.
  Line  numbers  200-240  relate  to  the  definition of your balloon and
contain 21 sets of three values, i.e. one set for each row on your design
chart.


7.4. SPRITE POINTERS

  The  sprite  pointer  indicates  where  you  have stored your sprite in
memory.  The  sprite pointers are stored in 8 bytes from location 2040 to
2047  inclusive.  The  normal  location  of the pointer for sprite 0 (the
first sprite) is 2040; the location for the pointer for sprite 1 is 2041;
and  so  on  with  location  2047 used as the location of the pointer for
sprite 7.
  Each sprite pointer can contain a value between 0 and 255. This number,
multiplied  by  64, corresponds to the start address of your sprite data.
Since  each  sprite uses 64 bytes, the sprite pointer can contain a block
number  anywhere  within  the first 16K block of memory accessible by the
VIC II chip, i.e. 256 * 64.  It is also possible to use other 16K blocks.
Further  details  can be found in the COMMODORE 64 Programmer's Reference
Guide.

NOTE:  It  is always advisable to store the data for your first sprite at
block  255  and  then  store  data  for  subsequent  sprites  in the next
available  blocks  working  downwards. This will prevent your sprite data
from interfering with the BASIC program. If you find that the sprite data
is writing over the end of your BASIC program, you must store your sprite
data  in the next available 16K block of memory or move the BASIC program
above the sprite data.  Again,  details on how to do this can be found in
the COMMODORE 64 Programmer's Reference Guide.

 In the balloon program, line 10:

                                V = 53248

assigns the value of the start address of the VIC II chip to the variable
V.  Later  in  the program you can add the register number to the address
stored in V. For example line 11:

                              POKE V + 21,4

references register number 21.
  Line 12 of the balloon program:

                              POKE 2042,255

places the data from sprite 2 into block 255.


7.5. TURNING SPRITES ON

  Before you see and use your sprites, you must first activate them.  You
do  this  by  using  the SPRITE ENABLE register,  register number 21.  As
mentioned above,  line 11 in the balloon program turns on sprite 2.  This
is done by placing the value 4 in the register. This is 2 to the power of
the sprite number 2, i.e. the sprite you are initializing.
  Refer  to  the structure of a byte earlier in the chapter if you do not
understand  how  we  get  this  value.  If  you had wanted to turn on two
sprites,  you would simply add the decimal values together.  For example,
to turn on sprites 2 and 3 add 8 and 4 (2^3 + 2^2). The instruction would
then be:
                             POKE V + 21,12

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIP:                                                                  |
|   An  easier  way  to  turn  on  a selected sprite is to use a simple |
| calculation that sets the required bit in the SPRITE ENABLE register. |
| In  the  program  statement below,  SN equals the sprite number (0-7) |
| that you want to turn on.                                             |
|                                                                       |
| POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21) OR (2^SN)                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


7.6. SPRITE COLORS

  A  sprite  can  be any of the 16 colors available on your COMMODORE 64.
The colors are numbered 0-15. Chapter 6 and Appendix G contain the colors
and their codes.  As you can see from the VIC II chip Register Map,  each
sprite  has  its own color register.  Register numbers 39-46 are used for
this purpose.  Register 39 holds the color for sprite 0,  register 40 for
sprite 1, and so on with register 46 holding the color for sprite 7.
  When  you see your sprite on the screen,  the dots are displayed in the
color  contained  in  the  color  register.  The  rest  of  the sprite is
transparent and shows whatever color is behind the sprite.
  If  you  wanted  to  change  the color of sprite 2 to light green (code
number 13),  simply POKE the color code in the sprite's color register as
follows:
                             POKE V + 41,13


7.7. POSITIONING SPRITES

  Now  you've  made  a sprite,  you want it to appear and move around the
screen. To do this your COMMODORE 64 uses three positioning registers:

  a) Sprite X Positioning Register
  b) Sprite Y Positioning Register
  c) Most Significant X Position Register

  The  X  and  Y  Position Registers work together to pinpoint where your
sprite  appears  on  the  screen.  The  X Position Register positions the
sprite in the horizontal direction  and the Y Position Register positions
the  sprite  in  the vertical direction.  On the VIC II chip register map
notice  that  registers  0-15 are used for the X and Y co-ordinates.  The
registers are arranged in pairs as follows:

  Register 0 holds the X co-ordinate for sprite 0
  Register 1 holds the Y co-ordinate for sprite 0
  Register 2 holds the X co-ordinate for sprite 1
  Register 3 holdo the Y co-ordinate for sprite 1

  This  pattern  is repeated with Registers 14 and 15 holding the X and Y
co-ordinates  for  sprite  7.  There  is a further register (16) which we
shall discuss later.
  You  can  position  your  sprite  by  simply  POKEing  values  into the
appropriate  registers.  You  need  both X and Y co-ordinates to position
your  sprite.  Calculate  all  positions from the TOP LEFT of your sprite
area.  It  does  not matter how many dots you fill up in the 24 x 21 dots
area  allocated  to your sprite design.  The position is still calculated
from the top left corner.
  If  you look at the balloon program once again, statement numbers 30-70
use  a  FOR...NEXT  loop to move the balloon diagonally across the screen
from left to right.  These statements increment the values of the X and Y
co-ordinates  by  POKEing  the  positions  into  registers  4  and 5, the
registers  for sprite 2,  until both values reach 200.  Line 70 then runs
the program again.
  You may have noticed that when the program was running, the balloon did
not  move  to  the far right hand side of the screen.  Positioning in the
horizontal  direction  is  difficult since you need 320 locations and you
therefore  need  an  additional  bit,  which will then give you up to 512
positions.  If you do not understand how we arrived at this figure, think
of  an extra bit being added to the left hand side of a byte.  This would
be the equivalent of 2 raised to the power of 8.
  The  extra  bits for all sprites are stored in the Most Significant Bit
Register  (MSB),  register  16.  Bits  0-7 of this register correspond to
sprites  0-7  respectively.  If  you are not using positions greater than
255,  the  corresponding  extra bit position must be turned off,  i.e. it
must contain a value of zero.
  Here's  how  the MSB works: after you've moved the sprite to X location
255,  POKE the sprite's decimal value into register 16.  For example,  to
move  sprite  6  to  horizontal  locations  256  through  320,  use  this
statement:

  POKE V + 16,64

  Then  use  a  loop  to move sprite 6 the 64 spaces from location 256 to
320:

  FOR X = 0 TO 63 : POKE V + 12,X : NEXT

  The  following  program  revises  the  original balloon program so that
sprite 2 moves all the way across the screen:

   10 V = 53248 : POKE V + 21,4 : POKE 2042,13
   20 FOR N = 0 TO 62 : READ Q : POKE 832 + N,Q : NEXT
   25 POKE V + 5,100
   30 FOR X = 0 TO 255
   40 POKE V + 4,X
   50 NEXT
   60 POKE V + 16,4
   70 FOR X = 0 TO 63
   80 POKE V + 4,X
   90 NEXT
  100 POKE V + 16,0
  110 GOTO 30

  Line 60 sets the most significant bit for sprite 2.
  Lines  70 through 90 contain the loop that moves sprite 2 across screen
locations 256 through 320.
  Line  100  turns  OFF  the MSB so that sprite 2 can go back to the left
edge of the screen.  In other words,  when the MSB is ON,  the sprite can
only  move from locations 256 through 320.  You have to turn the MSB back
OFF before you can move the sprite from locations 0 through 255.
  Note  that  the  program  we used for turning on individual sprites can
also  be  used  to set a specific MSB.  The complementary statement which
will turn OFF a specific bit is:

  POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21) AND (255-2^SN)

where SN is the number of the sprite you wish to move.


7.8. EXPANDED SPRITES

  You  can increase the size of each dot of the sprite so that the sprite
is twice as wide, twice as deep or expanded in both directions at once.
  There are two EXPAND registers:

  Register 23 doubles the width of the sprite
  Register 29 doubles the height of the sprite

  The method for expanding sprites is the same as that used when enabling
them,  e.g. to expand a specific sprite in the X direction only,  use the
following statement:

  POKE V+23, PEEK(V+23) OR 2^SN

where SN is the number of the sprite you wish to expand.
  The  same applies when doubling the height of a sprite except that this
time you use V+29.
  Try adding the following line to the original balloon program:

  25 POKE V + 23,4 : POKE V + 29,4 : REM EXPAND SPRITE

  When  you  type  &quot;RUN&quot;,  the  balloon has now doubled in size.  This is
because  you  POKEd the decimal value for sprite 2 (2^2) into register 23
which  doubles  the  height  of  the balloon,  and into register 29 which
doubles the width of the balloon.


7.9. CREATING MORE THAN ONE SPRITE

  lt is a simple operation to create and store more sprites. Instructions
on  how to do this are given earlier in this chapter.  To add sprite 3 to
your screen, include the following lines in the original balloon program:

  11 POKE V + 21,12
  12 POKE 2042,13 : POKE 2043,13
  30 FOR X = 1 TO 190
  45 POKE V + 6,X
  55 POKE V + 7,190 - X

  Line  11  turns  ON  sprites  2 and 3 by POKEing their combined decimal
values (4 and 8) into the SPRITE ENABLE register (21).
  Line  12  tells  the computer to find the data for the sprites in block
255 of the VIC II chip memory. Recall that 2042 is sprite 2's pointer and
2043 is the pointer for sprite 3.
  Lines 45 and 55  move sprite 3 around the screen by changing the values
of the X and Y co-ordinate registers of that sprite (V+6 and V+7).
  When  you  RUN the program, you will see two balloons moving around the
screen.  This  is  because  we  POKEd  the  same address into both sprite
pointers.
  The following lines put sprite 4 on the screen too:

  11 POKE V + 21,28
  12 POKE 2042,13 : POKE 2043,13 : POKE 2044,13
  25 POKE V + 23,12: POKE V + 29,12
  48 POKE V + 8,X
  58 POKE V + 9,100

  Line  11  turns ON sprites 2, 3 and 4 by POKEing their combined decimal
values (4, 8 and 16) into the SPRITE ENABLE register (21).
  Line  12  tells  the computer to find the data for all three sprites in
block 255 of memory.
  Line  25  doubles the size of sprites 2 and 3 by POKEing their combined
value  into the registers that control height and width expansion (23 and
29).
  Line  48 moves sprite 4 halfway along the X axis (horizontally).
  Line  58  positions  sprite  4 halfway down the screen at location 100.
Previously,  the Y co-ordinate has been changed in the program by the use
of a FOR...NEXT loop.  (See line 50 in the original program.) But now the
value  for  the  Y co-ordinate for sprite 4 (V + 9) stays the same during
the program. This means that sprite 4 only moves horizontally.


7.10. SPRITE PRIORITIES

  If  you  are  using  more  than one sprite you may wish to make sprites
cross over each other on the screen. Sprite to sprite priority is preset.
Sprites having the lowest numbers have the highest priority,  i.e. sprite
0 has the highest priority,  then sprite 1,  sprite 2, etc.  Sprite 7 has
the  lowest  priority.  Sprites with higher priorities appear in front of
sprites with lower priorities.
  Sprite  to  background  priority is controlled by the SPRITE BACKGROUND
PRIORITY register,  register 27.  Bits 0-7 in this register correspond to
sprites 0-7.  These bits are normally set OFF (equal to zero) which means
that  the  sprites have a higher priority than the background,  i.e. they
pass OVER any data on the screen. If you wish to switch this priority for
any  sprite(s)  you  must  turn ON the relevant bit(s).  For example, the
statement:
                           POKE V + 27,8

makes sprite 3 appear behind the characters that are on the screen.


7.11. TURNING SPRITES OFF

  You  can  make  a  sprite  disappear by setting the relevant bit in the
SPRITE ENABLE register (21) OFF. Do this using the following statement:

            POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21) AND (255-2^SN)

where SN is the number of the sprite you wish to turn off.

Boolean Operators

  This  instruction  in  the  previous  example  uses  what is known as a
LOGICAL OPERATOR, sometimes known as a BOOLEAN OPERATOR. In that example,
the  AND was the logical operator.  It is used to modify the first of two
elements in the statement,  i.e. register 21.  It logically compares each
corresponding  bit  of  the result of the PEEK statement according to the
following rules:

                               1 AND 1 = 1
                               0 AND 1 = 0
                               1 AND 0 = 0
                               0 AND 0 = 0

  This is known as a TRUTH TABLE.  As you can see, the bit being compared
is set OFF unless both bits contain 1.  You can apply the above statement
to set OFF bits in any register for any sprite number.  For example,  you
could  have  used  the same instruction to reduce the size of a sprite by
simply  substituting  either  register 23 or 29.  Let us see what happens
when we turn off sprite 3.
  Before the instruction is executed, register 21 contains 00001000.  The
result of the expression after the PEEK statement is: 255 - 2^3 (8) = 247
or  11110111,  i.e. after the instruction has been executed,  register 21
contains  zero.  If  other sprites had been ON,  they would remain in the
same state since both bits would have contained 1.
  The other Boolean operator we have used is OR. The truth table for this
operator is as follows:
                               1 OR 1 = 1
                               0 OR 1 = 1
                               1 OR 0 = 1
                               0 OR 0 = 0

  If either bit is set, the corresponding result bit will also be set.
  This   chapter   has   only   been  an  introduction  to  sprites.  Try
experimenting yourself with the design and animation of your own sprites.
Further  details  about  sprite handling can be found in the COMMODORE 64
Programmer's Reference Guide.



8. MAKING SOUND AND MUSIC


  Your   COMMODORE  64   computer  is  equipped  with  one  of  the  most
sophisticated  electronic  music  synthesizers available on any computer.
This chapter is an introduction to using your computer's sound chip,  the
SID chip. The main features that the SID chip provides are:

  a) Volume control
  b) Multiple voices
  c) Waveform
  d) Frequency
  e) Envelope generator (attack, decay, sustain, release)


8.1. The SID Chip

  The SID  (Sound  Interface  Device)  chip contains 29  8-bit registers,
numbered  0-28,  each  of which is responsible for a certain component of
sound  generation.  In this chapter,  you will only be concerned with the
first  25  registers.  These  are stored between locations 54272 to 54296
inclusive.
  Here is a summary of the SID register map:

  REGISTER No.    DESCRIPTION

  0-6             VOICE 1
  7-13            VOICE 2
  14-20           VOICE 3
  21              LOW FREQUENCY
  22              HIGH FREQUENCY
  24              VOLUME CONTROL AND FILTERS

  Before  we  go  on  to  discuss  how  sounds  are created,  type in the
following program and RUN it. This will demonstrate just a little of what
may be achieved by the SID chip.

EXAMPLE PROGRAM 1:

   5 S=54272
  10 FOR L=S TO S+24:POKE L,0:NEXT: REM CLEAR SOUND CHIP
  20 POKE S+5,9:POKE S+6,0
  30 POKE S+24,15: REM SET MAXIMUM VOLUME LEVEL
  40 READ HF,LF,DR
  50 IF HF&lt;0 THEN END
  60 POKE S+1,HF:POKE S,LF
  70 POKE S+4,33
  80 FOR T=1 TO DR:NEXT
  90 POKE S+4,32:FOR T=1 TO 50:NEXT
 100 GOTO 40
 110 DATA 25,177,250,28,214,250
 120 DATA 25,177,250,25,177,250
 130 DATA 25,177,125,28,214,125
 140 DATA 32,94,750,25,177,250
 150 DATA 28,214,250,19,63,250
 160 DATA 19,63,250,19,63,250
 170 DATA 21,154,63,24,63,63
 180 DATA 25,177,250,24,63,125
 190 DATA 19,63,250,-1,-1,-1

  Line  5  stores  the  start  location  of the SID chip in S.  All other
registers are accessed by simply adding their numbers to S.

VOLUME CONTROL

  Your  COMMODORE  64  has 16 volume levels,  numbered from 0 (off) to 15
(maximum volume).  Register 24 in the SID chip controls the volume level.
To set the volume, you simply POKE the value you want into this register.
Line 30 in the example program sets the maximum volume level (15).
  You  would  normally  only  set  the  volume  at  the beginning of your
program.  Note that the volume level determines the output from all three
of your 64's voices.

VOICES

  Your  COMMODORE 64 has three voices,  which may be played separately or
simultaneously. The register map for each voice is shown below:

FREQUENCY

  Sound is created by the movement of air. Think of throwing a stone into
a  pool  and  seeing  the  waves radiate outward.  When similar waves are
created in air, we hear a sound.  Every sound produced on your 64 is made
up  from  a  high  and low frequency value.  Each of three voices has two
registers  in  which  the frequency values are stored.  The two values in
each voice are combined to form the frequency value in 16 bit form.
  A  chart  showing  the  memory  locations  to each voice's high and low
frequency registers is shown below:

 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
 |         VOICE        |       FREQUENCY      |      POKE NUMBER      |
 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
 |           1          |         HIGH         |         54273         |
 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
 |           1          |         LOW          |         54272         |
 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
 |           2          |         HIGH         |         54280         |
 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
 |           2          |         LOW          |         54279         |
 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
 |           3          |         HIGH         |         54287         |
 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
 |           3          |         LOW          |         54286         |
 +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

  To  play  a  musical  note  or  sound,  you  must POKE the sound's high
frequency  value  into the high frequency location of the voice you want,
and  POKE  the  note's low frequency value into the voice's low frequency
location.  Line  60  in  the  example  program  POKEs  the  high  and low
frequencies from the DATA statements into registers 1 and 0 respectively.
This sets the frequency for voice 1.

CREATING OTHER FREQUENCIES

  To  create  a  frequency other than those listed in the note table, use
the following formula:

                           F = FYOUT / .06097

where FYOUT is the frequency you require.
  To  create  the  high  and low frequency values for the note,  you must
first make F into an integer, i.e. delete any numbers to the right of the
decimal point.
  Now use this formula to calculate the high frequency location:

                          HI = INT ( F / 256 )

and the following formula to give you the low frequency location:

                          LO = F - (256 * HI)

  Then  to  obtain  the  note,  simply POKE the value for LO into the low
frequency  register and the value for HI into the high frequency register
of the voice from which you wish to output the sound.

WAVEFORMS

  The type of waveform you select determines the timbre or quality of the
sound produced.
  There are four types of waveforms:

TRIANGLE.  This  waveform  contains few harmonics and a mellow flute-like
sound. The shape of the triangle waveform looks like this:


                                     /\
                                   /    \
                                 /        \
                 ............../............\.............
                    \        /                \        /
                      \    /                    \    /
                        \/                        \/


SAWTOOTH.  This  waveform  contains  all the harmonics.  It has a bright,
brassy quality. Here is what the sawtooth waveform looks like:


                       +             +             +
                      /|            /|            /|
                    /  |          /  |          /  |
                  /    |        /    |        /    |
              .........|..... /......|....../......|........
                       |    /        |    /        |    /
                       |  /          |  /          |  /
                       |/            |/            |/
                       +             +             +


VARIABLE PULSE WAVE.  This  waveform contains variable rectangular waves.
Changing the pulse width makes sounds ranging from a bright, hollow noise
to a nasal, reedy pulse. Here's what it looks like:


            +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+   |
            |           |   |           |   |           |   |
            |           |   |           |   |           |   |
            |           |   |           |   |           |   |
          ..|...........|...|...........|...|...........|...|..
            |           |   |           |   |           |   |
            |           |   |&lt;---------&gt;|   |           |   |
            |           |   |   PULSE   |   |           |   |
            |           +---+   WIDTH   +---+           +---+


WHITE NOISE.  This  waveform  is  used  mainly  for  sound  effects (e.g.
explosions, gunshots, surf) and ranges from a low rumbling to hissing. It
looks like this:


                                 .   .       .
                        .     . .          .   .
                         .  .     .       .
                      ............................
                           . . .        .
                                    .  . .  .
                          .                   . .


  The waveforms for each voice is held in three control registers.  These
are numbered  4,  11 and 18.  The component parts of the control register
for each voice are as follows:

  BIT No.         DESCRIPTION

    0             GATE
   1-3            UNUSED
    4             TRIANGLE WAVEFORM
    5             SAWTOOTH WAVEFORM
    6             PULSE WAVEFORM
    7             NOISE WAVEFORM

  The  GATE bit controls the Envelope Generator.  When this bit is set to
1,  it triggers the Envelope Generator and the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle
begins.  When the bit is reset to zero, the RELEASE cycle begins. Setting
bits 4,5 or 6 to 1 selects that particular waveform.
  Line 70 in the program sets the output of the sound for voice 1 using a
Sawtooth waveform. This line also sets the GATE bit.
  You  can  set combinations of these bits,  i.e. Pulse and Sawtooth, but
this will produce pretty weird sounds!

THE ENVELOPE GENERATOR

  The  volume of a musical tone changes from the moment you first hear it
until  it  dies out and you can't hear it any more.  When a note is first
struck,  it rises from zero volume to its peak volume.  The rate at which
this happens is called the ATTACK.  It then falls from the peak to a mid-
range  volume  level.  The rate at which this occurs is called the DECAY.
The  mid-ranged  volume is called the SUSTAIN level.  When the note stops
playing,  it  falls  from  the SUSTAIN level to zero volume.  The rate at
which it falls is called the RELEASE. The following is an illustration of
the four phases of a note:


                              +
                             /.\
                            / .  \
                           /  .    \
        SUSTAIN LEVEL . . / . . . . +-----------+
                         /    .     .           . \
                        /     .     .           .   \
                       /      .     .           .     \
                      .       .     .           .      .
                      .       .     .           .      .
                      .   A   .  D  .     S     .   R  .


NOTE: ATTACK, DECAY and RELEASE are RATES. SUSTAIN is a LEVEL.

  Each of the cycles above give certain qualities and restrictions to the
shape,  or  ENVELOPE  of  a  sound.  These bounds are collectively called
parameters.  The ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN/RELEASE parameters are collectively
called ADSR.
  There  are  two  registers used for the ADSR parameters for each of the
three voices. These are 5 and 6 for voice 1, 12 and 13 for voice 2 and 19
and  20  for voice 3.  The ATTACK and DECAY parameters share the first of
each  pair  of  registers  (5,  12,  19)  while  the  SUSTAIN and RELEASE
parameters use registers 6, 13 and 20.
  These  pairings  are  used  because the settings only require 4 bits or
half  a byte.  This amount of storage is called a NYBBLE.  The first four
bits  of  a  byte  are  called the HIGH NYBBLE and the last four bits are
called  the  LOW  NYBBLE.  The  ATTACK  settings for the three voices are
stored in the high nybbles of registers  5, 12  and  19,  while the DECAY
settings  are  stored in the low nybbles of these registers.  The SUSTAIN
settings for the three voices use the high nybbles in registers 6, 13 and
20, while the RELEASE settings use the low nybbles in the same registers.
  Before POKEing any value into the ADSR registers you must first combine
the high and low nybbles by adding them together. For example, the ATTACK
rates occupy the 2^7, 2^6, 2^5, and 2^4 bits,  so the values are 128, 64,
32 and 16. DECAY rates use the 2^3, 2^2, 2^1 and 2^0 bits, or 8, 4, 2 and
16.  Suppose  you  want  to  set a high ATTACK value (12) and a low DECAY
value (2). An easy way to combine the two rates is to multiply the ATTACK
value by 16 and add it to the DECAY value. In this example, the resulting
value is 194, i.e. 12*16+2. You can use this formula whenever you wish to
combine two values (range 0-15) into a high/low nybble format.
  Line  20  in the example program sets the ATTACK/DECAY rate to 0 ATTACK
and 9 DECAY.
  The  maximum  ATTACK  rate  is  achieved  by  using  a  value of 15 and
multiplying it by 16.  You can increase the DECAY rate by adding together
all the DECAY values i.e. 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15,  which is the MAXIMUM DECAY
RATE.

  Here are some sample ATTACK/DECAY POKEs:

 +----------------+-------+----------------------+---------------------+
 |                | VOICE |        ATTACK        |        DECAY        |
 +----------------+-------+----------------------+---------------------+
 | POKE 54277,66  |   1   |        MED(64)       |        LOW(2)       |
 | POKE 54284,66  |   2   |       MED(64) +      |                     |
 |                |       |        LOW(32)       |        MED(4)       |
 | POKE 54291,15  |   3   |         ZERO         |         MAX         |
 |                |       |                      |   (8 + 4 + 2 + 1)   |
 | POKE 54284,255 |   2   |          MAX         |         MAX         |
 |                |       | (128 + 64 + 32 + 16  |  + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1)   |
 +----------------+-------+----------------------+---------------------+

  Here's  a  sample program that illustrates what you can do with ATTACK/
DECAY settings:

  10 FOR L=54272 TO 54296:POKE L,0:NEXT  ..... Clears the SID chip
  20 POKE 54296,15  .......................... Set maximum volume
  30 POKE 54277,64  .......................... Set ATTACK/DECAY
  40 POKE 54273,162:POKE 54272,37  ........... POKE one note in voice 1
  50 PRINT&quot;PRESS ANY KEY&quot;  ................... Screen message
  60 GET K$:IF K$=&quot;&quot; THEN 60  ................ Check the keyboard
  70 POKE 54276,17:FOR T=1 TO 200:NEXT  ...... Start triangle waveform
  80 POKE 54276,16:FOR T=1 TO 50:NEXT  ....... Stop note
  90 GOTO 50  ................................ Repeat execution

  After  you  RUN the program a few times,  try changing the ATTACK/DECAY
setting by changing line 30:

  30 POKE 54277,190

  Now  RUN  the program again and notice the difference in the note.  Try
other combinations of ATTACK and DECAY settings to get an idea of how you
can use different ATTACK/DECAY rates to create a variety of sound
effects.

  SUSTAIN/RELEASE SETTING.  Like  ATTACK/DECAY,  SUSTAIN/RELEASE  share a
byte.  But  remember  that  this  sharing doesn't mean that  SUSTAIN  and
RELEASE are alike.  SUSTAIN is a LEVEL,  while RELEASE,  ATTACK and DECAY
are RATES.
  SUSTAIN  is a proportion of maximum volume.  You can sustain,  or hold,
notes and sounds at any of 16 volume levels.
  This table shows you what numbers to POKE for SUSTAIN/RELEASE values:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  HIGH  | MEDIUM |   LOW  | LOWEST |  HIGH  |  MED.  |   LOW  | LOWEST |
| SUSTAIN| SUSTAIN| SUSTAIN| SUSTAIN| RELEASE| RELEASE| RELEASE| RELEASE|
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   128  |   64   |   32   |   16   |    8   |    4   |    2   |    1   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

NOTE:  You  can  increase  the  SUSTAIN  level by adding together all the
SUSTAIN  values:  128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240,  which is the MAXIMUM SUSTAIN
LEVEL.  A  SUSTAIN  level of 128 is approximately 50% of volume.  You can
increase  the  RELEASE  rate  by  adding together all the RELEASE values:
8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15, which is the MAXIMUM RELEASE RATE.
  Combine the SUSTAIN level and RELEASE rate the same way you combine the
ATTACK  and  DECAY  rates:  add  the two values and POKE the total to the
memory location of the voice you want.
  To  see  the  effects of the sustain level setting add this line to the
last sample program:

  35 POKE 54278,128

  Now  RUN the program again and note the change.  With line 35,  we tell
the computer to sustain the note at a  HIGH SUSTAIN LEVEL (128).  You can
vary  the  duration of a note by changing the count in line 70.  Remember
that  the sustain level maintains a note at a proportion of the volume as
the  note  falls  from its peak volume;  this isn't the same thing as the
note's duration.
  To  see  the  effect  of  the  release  rate,  try  changing line 35 to
POKE 54278,89 (SUSTAIN = 80, RELEASE = 9).


8.2. SAMPLE SOUND PROGRAM

  This  brief  sound  program summarizes what you've learned so far about
making music on your 64:

1. Choose  the  voice(s)  you  want  to use.  Recall that each voice uses
   different memory locations into which you'll POKE values for waveform,
   ATTACK rate, etc.  You can play  1, 2, or 3  voice together,  but this
   program only uses voice 1.
2. Clear the SID chip:              5 FOR L=54272 TO 54296:POKE L,0:NEXT
3. Set VOLUME:                     10 POKE 54296,15
4. Set ATTACK/DECAY rates:
   to define how fast a note rises
   to and falls from its peak
   volume level (0-255):           20 POKE 54277,190
5. Set SUSTAIN/RELEASE to define
   level to hold note and rate to
   release it:                     30 POKE 54278,248
6. Find note you want to play in
   the TABLE OF MUSICAL NOTES in
   Appendix M and enter the HIGH-
   FREQUENCY and LOW-FREQUENCY
   values for that note
   (each note requires 2 POKEs):   40 POKE 54273,16:POKE 54272,195
7. Start WAVEFORM (here,
   TRIANGLE):                      50 POKE 54276,17
8. Enter a timing loop to time
   between notes (we use 250 for
   a quarter note):                60 FOR T=1 TO 250:NEXT
9. STOP note by turning off
   chosen waveform:                70 POKE 54276,16

  Here's  a  longer  program  that  further demonstrates your 64's music-
making abilities:

   5 REM MUSICAL SCALE
   7 FOR L=54272 TO 54296:POKE L,0:NEXT  clears SID chip
  10 POKE 54296,15  .................... sets VOLUME
  20 POKE 54277,7:POKE 54278,133  ...... sets ADSR
  50 READ A  ........................... READs 1st number from line 110
  55 IF A=-1 THEN END  ................. ENDs loop
  60 READ B  ........................... READs 2nd number
  80 POKE 54273,A:POKE 54272,B  ........ POKEs 1st number from line 110
                                         as HIGH-FREQUENCY and 2nd
                                         number as LOW-FREQUENCY
  85 POKE 54276,17  .................... starts note
  90 FOR T=1 TO 250:NEXT:POKE 54276,16   lets note play, then stops it
  95 FOR T=1 TO 50:NEXT  ............... sets time for RELEASE, time
                                         between notes
 100 GOTO 20  .......................... restarts program
 110 DATA 16,195,18,209,21,31,22,96 .... lists note value
 120 DATA 25,30,28,49,31,165,33,135 .... from chart in Appendix M. Each
                                         part of numbers = one note
                                         (16 and 19 = 4th octave C)
 999 DATA -1  .......................... ENDs program (see line 55)

  You  can  change  to  a  sawtooth  wave  by  changing  line  85 to read
POKE 54276,33  and  line 90  to  read  FOR T=1 TO 250:NEXT:POKE 54276,32.
Changing  the  waveform  can  dramatically change the sound your computer
produces.
  You  can  also  change  the sound in other ways.  For example,  you can
change the harpsichord-like sound in the previous program to a banjo-like
sound by changing the ATTACK/DECAY rate of each note. Do this by changing
line 20 to read:

  20 POKE 54277,3:POKE 54278,0  ........ creates banjo effect by setting
                                         zero SUSTAIN

  As  this  program  demonstrates,  your  64  can sound like a variety of
musical instruments.


8.3. PLAYING A SONG ON YOUR 64

  The  next  program lets you play a line from a song,  &quot;Michael Row Your
Boat Ashore&quot;.  The program uses the  PULSE waveform,  which is a variable
width rectangular wave.  The third and fourth POKEs in line 10 define the
pulse width for this song.
  In  this  song,  we use a duration count of 125 for an eighth note, 250
for a quarter note,  375 for a dotted quarter note,  500 for a half note,
and  1000  for  a  whole note.  When you program your own songs,  you can
increase  or  decrease  these numbers to match a particular tempo or your
own musical taste.

 120 DATA -1

  Line 2 clears the SID chip.
  Line  5  assigns the lowest SID chip memory location to the variable S.
Throughout  the  rest  of the program,  we just add the number of the SID
register to this variable.  For example,  POKE S+24,15  POKEs  15  to the
volume register, which is 54296, or 54272+24.
  Line 10 POKEs values into:

1. The volume register: POKE S+24,15
2. Voice 1, ATTACK/DECAY rates: POKE S+5,88
3. Pulse width: POKE S+3,15 and POKE S+2,15
4. Voice 1, SUSTAIN level/RELEASE rate: POKE S+6,89

  Line 20 READs the first number from the DATA statement.  If that number
is  -1,  the program ENDs automatically.  This occurs when the final DATA
statement (line 120) is read.
  Line 30 READs the second number from the DATA list.
  Line 40 READs the third number from the DATA list.
  Line 60 POKEs:

1. The value for H  that was assigned in the READ H statement in line 20.
   Until  -1  is  read,  this  value  is  assigned  to the HIGH FREQUENCY
   register.
2. The value for L  that was assigned in the READ L statement in line 30.
   This value is assigned to the  LOW FREQUENCY register.  Together these
   two POKEs determine the pitch for one note.
3. The value that turns ON the variable pulse waveform for voice 1.

  Line 70 uses a loop to set the duration for the note being played.  The
value for D is assigned in the READ statement in line 40. As you can see,
the numbers in the DATA lists are clustered into threes: the first number
(e.g., 35)  is  the  high  frequency value for a note,  the second number
(e.g., 135)  is the low frequency value for the same note,  and the third
number (e.g., 250) sets the duration for that note  (e.g., a quarter note
C).
  Line 80 is a timing loop that determines release time between notes.
  Line 90 sends the program back to READ the number set for another note.
  Lines 100 through 120 contain all the DATA for the line from this song.


8.4. CREATING SOUND EFFECTS

  Your  64's  SID  chip  lets you create a wide variety of sound effects,
such  as  an  explosion  during  a game,  or a buzzer that warns you when
you've made a mistake.
  Here are just a few suggestions for creating sound effects:

1. Vary rapidly between two notes to create a tremor sound.
2. Use the multivoice effects to play more than one voice at a time, with
   each  voice independently controlled,  so you have different noises at
   once. Or use one voice as an echo or response to another voice.
3. Use the different pulse widths to create different sounds.
4. Use  the  NOISE  WAVEFORM  to  make  white noise to accent tonal sound
   effects, create explosion noises, gunshots, footsteps, or alarms. When
   you  use  the  noise  waveform with the same musical notes that create
   music, you can create different types of white noise.
5. Combine  several  HIGH/LOW  FREQUENCIES  in  rapid  succession  across
   different octaves.
6. Try POKEing the extra note settings in Appendix M.

  Here  are  some  sample  sound  effects  programs.   The  Commodore  64
Programmer's  Reference  Guide  contains  more  examples  as well as more
information on creating sound effects.

  The loop that begins in line 20 sets up fading volume so that the sound
of the gunshot starts at high volume  (15)  and fades to  0  as the loops
executes.
  Press the &lt;STOP&gt; key to end this program.
  As  we've said before,  the best way to learn a new area of programming
is to experiment.


8.5. FILTERING

  Sometimes a certain waveform may not have quite the timbre you require.
For example, it would be difficult to imagine any of the preset waveforms
in the SID chip sounding anything like a trumpet.  To give you additional
control  over  the sound parameters,  the SID chip is equipped with three
FILTERS.

HIGH-PASS FILTER.  This filter reduces the level of frequencies below the
specified cutoff frequency. It passes all the frequencies at or above the
cutoff, while cutting down the frequencies below the cutoff.

LOW-PASS FILTER.  As its name implies, this filter passes the frequencies
below the cutoff and reduces the level of those above.

BAND-PASS FILTER.  This filter passes a narrow band of frequencies around
the cutoff and cuts down the level of all others.

  An extra filter,  called the  NOTCH REJECT FILTER can be synthesized by
combining the  high  and  low pass filters.  This passes frequencies away
from the cutoff while reducing the level at the cutoff frequency.

  Register 24 determines which filter type you want to use. Remember that
this is also the register used for the volume control. The following bits
are used for filters:

  BIT No.         USAGE

  4               SELECT LOW-PASS FILTER
  5               SELECT BAND-PASS FILTER
  6               SELECT HIGH-PASS FILTER

  A filter is activated by setting the relevant bit in register 24.
  You  may  not  wish to filter all voices at the same time.  Register 23
determines which voices are to be filtered. The bits are as follows:

  BIT No.         USAGE

  7-4             FILTER RESONANCE 0-15
  3               FILTER EXTERNAL INPUT
  2               FILTER VOICE 3
  1               FILTER VOICE 2
  0               FILTER VOICE 1

  When  a specific bit is set,  the output of that voice will be diverted
through the filter.
  The  cutoff  frequency  is  an eleven bit number.  The upper eight bits
(11-3)  are  stored in  register 22  while the lower three bits (0-2) are
stored  in  register 21.  This  gives you a range of values between 0 and
2047.
  Try  adding  the  following  lines to the example program to filter the
voice  and  hear  the  difference  in sound.  We will be using a Low Pass
filter  which  will  allow  only the lower components of the sounds to be
heard.

  30 POKE S+24,31: REM FULL VOLUME PLUS LOW PASS FILTER
  35 POKE S+23,1: REM SELECT FILTER FOR VOICE 1
  37 POKE S+22,128:POKE S+21,7: REM SELECT CUTOFF FREQUENCY

  Try experimenting with filters.  Filtering a sound as it passes through
the ADSR phases of its life can produce interesting effects.
  For  further  information  on  how  to  use  the SID chip,  consult the
COMMODORE 64 Programmer's Reference Guide.


8.6. MUSIC COMPOSER

  The  Commodore  MUSIC COMPOSER cartridge allows you to compose music on
your COMMODORE 64 without having to concern yourself with the workings of
the  SID  chip.  Facilities  are provided to allow you to type in program
lines that consist purely of special control characters. This enables you
to play any combination of sounds that you require using all the features
of the SID chip. Once you have composed your masterpiece, you can save it
on  tape  and  then  play  it  back  at your leisure.  While the music is
playing,  a music stave scrolls across the screen displaying the notes as
they are being played.  This allows you to get the most from the SID chip
with the minimum of effort.



9. ADVANCED DATA HANDLING


9.1. READ AND DATA STATEMENTS

  So  far  we've  shown  you  how  to assign values to variables directly
(A = 2), and how to assign values while the program is RUNning (INPUT and
GET).
  But  often  you'll  find that neither way suits your needs for variable
assignment in a program, especially when you have large amounts of data.
  In  the  Chapter  7  when we introduced sprites,  we used READ and DATA
statements  to  assign  values  for sprites.  Here's a short program that
shows you how these two statements work together:

  10 READ X
  20 PRINT &quot;X IS NOW :&quot;; X
  30 GOTO 10
  40 DATA 1, 34, 10.5, 16, 234.56

  RUN
  X IS NOW : 1
  X IS NOW : 34
  X IS NOW : 10.5
  X IS NOW : 16
  X IS NOW : 234.56
  ?OUT OF DATA ERROR IN 10
  READY.
  _

  Line 10  READs  a  value from the DATA statement at line 40 and assigns
the value to X.
  Line 30 tells the computer to return to line 10, where the READ assigns
the  next value in the DATA statement to X.  The loop continues until all
the DATA values are read.
  There  are  a  few  important rules you must remember when you use DATA
statements:

o Follow the Data statement format precisely:

  40 DATA 1, 34, 10.5, 16, 234.56

  Comma separates each item.

o Use:

  -- integer numbers (e.g., 34),
  -- real numbers (e.g., 234.56),
  -- numbers expressed in scientific notation (e.g., 2.4E+04),
  -- words (as long as you use a string variable in the READ statement),

  but DON'T use:

  -- variables or
  -- arithmetic operations

  in  DATA  statements.  The items listed below are treated as strings if
  you try to READ them, and you can only READ them as strings with string
  variables in the READ statement.

                         DATA A, 23/56, 2*5, B + 2

  When  you  use  a  READ statement,  you can only get values from a DATA
statement because the two statements work as partners. Each time you READ
a  value,  the  computer  knows  to  move  to  the next value in the DATA
statement.  In effect, there's a pointer in the computer that keeps track
of your place in the DATA statement.  After READing the first value,  the
DATA statement looks like this:

                     40 DATA 1, 34, 10.5, 16, 234.56
                                |
                             pointer

  When  the last DATA value has been assigned to the variable in the READ
statement  and  the computer tries to execute the loop again,  the OUT OF
DATA ERROR is displayed.
  Here's an example that shows one way to avoid the OUT OF DATA ERROR.

  NEW

  10 FOR X = 1 TO 3
  15 READ A$
  20 PRINT &quot;A$ IS NOW : &quot;; A$
  30 NEXT
  40 DATA THIS, IS, FUN

  RUN
  A$ IS NOW : THIS
  A$ IS NOW : IS
  A$ IS NOW : FUN
  READY.

  This time we put the READ statement inside a FOR/NEXT loop that limited
the  number  of  READings  to  equal  the  numbers  of  items in the DATA
statement.
  As  long  as  you  know how many items will be in your DATA statements,
this method is fine. But often either you won't know or you won't want to
bother to count.
  Sometimes  the  best  way  to avoid an OUT OF DATA ERROR is to end your
DATA  statement  with  a  FLAG.  A  flag  is  some  value  that would not
ordinarily  appear in your DATA list,  such as a negative number,  a very
large  number,  a very small number,  or a special word,  such as  END or
STOP.  When you use a flag, add an IF/THEN statement to tell the computer
to  branch  to  another  part  of the program when the flag is read.  For
example:

  10 READ A
  15 IF A &lt; 0 THEN END
  20 DATA 13, 35, 29, -999
  25 PRINT &quot;TOTAL = &quot;; A
  30 GOTO 10

  This  program  READs  and  PRINTs  a value for A until it reaches -999.
Line 15 tells the computer to END the program immediately when a negative
value is read.
  There  is  also  a  way  to  reuse  the  items  in  a DATA statement by
RESTOREing the data pointer to the beginning of the DATA list. Try adding
this line:

  45 RESTORE

to  the second program in this chapter and RUN it again.  You'll see that
the  data  pointer  has been RESTOREd to the first item in the DATA list,
and that you can reREAD all the items.


9.2. CALCULATING AVERAGES

  Here's  a  program  that  READs  a  set of numbers from a DATA list and
calculates  their  average.  This  program  also  uses a flag to tell the
computer when to stop READing DATA.

   5 T = 0: CT = 0
  10 READ X
  20 IF X = -1 THEN 50: REM CHECK FOR FLAG
  25 CT = CT + 1
  30 T = T + X: REM UPDATE TOTAL
  40 GOTO 10
  50 PRINT &quot;THERE WERE&quot;; CT ;&quot;VALUES READ&quot;
  60 PRINT &quot;TOTAL =&quot;; T
  70 PRINT &quot;AVERAGE =&quot;; T/CT
  80 DATA 75, 80, 62, 91, 87, 93, 78, -1

  RUN
  THERE WERE 7 VALUES READ
  TOTAL = 566
  AVERAGE = 80.8571429

  Line 5 sets CT, the CounTer, and T, the Total, to zero.
  Line 10 READs a value from the DATA list and assigns it to X.
  Line 20 checks to see if the value read to X is our flag (-1). If it
is, then the program skips lines 25-40 and goes straight to line 50.
  Line 25 adds one to CT, the counter, if the value of X is not the flag.
  Line 30 adds X to T, the running total.
  Line 40 sends the program back to repeat line 10.
  Line 50, which isn't executed until line 10 READs the flag, PRINTs the
number of values read (CT).
  Line 60 PRINTs the total of the numbers read (T).
  Line 70 PRINTs the average.
  You can also use more than one variable in the READ statement.  You can
mix  the  types  of  DATA  in  a DATA list when you also mix the types of
variables in the READ statement. Here's a program that does just that. It
READs  a  name  and  some  scores  and then calculates the average of the
scores.

  NEW

  10 READ N$, A, B, C
  20 PRINT N$;&quot;'S SCORES WERE :&quot;; A ;&quot; &quot;; B ;&quot; &quot;; C
  30 PRINT &quot;AND THE AVERAGE IS :&quot;; (A + B + C) / 3
  40 PRINT: GOTO 10
  50 DATA MIKE, 190, 185, 165, DICK, 225, 245, 190
  60 DATA JOHN, 155, 185, 205, PAUL, 160, 179, 187

  RUN
  MIKE'S SCORES WERE : 190   185   165
  AND THE AVERAGE IS : 180

  DICK'S SCORES WERE : 225   245   190
  AND THE AVERAGE IS : 220

  Line 10  READs  a  value for each of the variables.  The DATA statement
lists its items in the same order that the READ statement expects to find
them.  In other words, there's a name to go with the string variable, and
numbers to go with the integer variables.


9.3. SUBSCRIBED VARIABLES

  So far we've only used simple BASIC variables such as  X  and  X$. It's
doubtful  that  you'll  write a program that requires more variable names
than all the combinations of letters and numbers available in BASIC,  but
you  might  want  to be able to group variable names together when you're
using groups of data.
  Subscripted  variables  let  you  use  variable  names so that they are
obviously grouped together. For example:

  A(0), A(1), A(2), A(3)

  The numbers in parentheses are the  SUBSCRIPTS of variable A.  Be aware
that the variable A1 does NOT equal the subscripted variable A(1).
  You  can  use  variables  and  arithmetic  operation as subscripts. For
example:

  A(X)  A(X+1)  A(4-1)  A(2*X)

  The  expressions  within the parentheses are evaluated according to the
same rules for arithmetic operations outlined in Chapter 3.
  Subscripted  variables,  like simple variables,  name a memory location
within the computer.  But only subscripted variables name values that are
organized into an ARRAY.
  An ARRAY is understood by the computer to be a unit,  such as a list or
a table, of related values.
  The  following  example  uses  subscripted  variables  to  calculate an
average:

   5 PRINT CHR$(147)
  10 INPUT &quot;HOW MANY NUMBERS :&quot;; X
  20 FOR A = 1 TO X
  30 PRINT &quot;ENTER VALUE #&quot;; A ;: INPUT B(A)
  40 NEXT
  50 SU = 0
  60 FOR A = 1 TO X
  70 SU = SU + B(A)
  80 NEXT
  90 PRINT: PRINT &quot;AVERAGE =&quot;; SU/X

  RUN

  HOW MANY NUMBERS :? 5
  ENTER VALUE # 1 ? 125
  ENTER VALUE # 2 ? 167
  ENTER VALUE # 3 ? 189
  ENTER VALUE # 4 ? 167
  ENTER VALUE # 5 ? 158

  AVERAGE = 161.2

  Line 5 clears the screen.
  Line 10  asks  you  to  enter the total number of items you'll INPUT at
line 30.
  Line 20 sets up a loop that makes A the subscript for the array B.  The
loop adds 1 to A for every execution. This updates array B.
  Line 30 prompts you to INPUT a value for the subscripted variable B(A).
  Lines 50 through 80 keep a running total (SU) of the numbers INPUT.
  Line 90 PRINTs the average.
  Each  time  the INPUT loop executes,  A is increased by 1,  so the next
value  entered is assigned to the next element in array B.  At the end of
the program, array B looks like this:

        +---------+
  B(1)  |   125   |
        +---------+
  B(2)  |   167   |
        +---------+
  B(3)  |   189   |
        +---------+
  B(4)  |   167   |
        +---------+
  B(5)  |   158   |
        +---------+

  After you INPUT all the values, they are stored in array B. You can now
access these values just by using the subscripted variables. For example,
see what happens when you add these lines:

  100 PRINT B(X-1)
  120 PRINT B(3)
  130 PRINT B(X-3)


9.4. DIMENSIONING ARRAYS

  If you try to enter more than ten numbers in an array, you'll get a BAD
SUBSCRIPT  ERROR.  Arrays of more than ten elements need to be predefined
in  a DIMension statement.  For example,  if you want an array to hold 25
values, you'd write this statement in your program:

  DIM B(25)

  You can also use a variable in a DIMension statement.  For example,  in
the  last  program you could have used this statement since X equaled the
total number of values in array B:

  15 DIM B(X)

  But be careful when you use variables to define arrays:  once  an array
is DIMensioned, it can't be reDIMensioned in another part of the program.
So don't use a variable whose value will change in the program.
  You can use more than one array in a program,  and  you  can  DIMension
them all on the same line:

  10 DIM A(12), B(35), C(3,5)

  Arrays A and B are one-dimensional arrays,  but  C is a two-dimensional
array. One-dimensional arrays just have rows of data, but two-dimensional
arrays have both rows and columns of data, just like a chart. Array C has
3  rows  and  5  columns.  Rows  are  always  listed first in a DIMension
statement.


9.5. SIMULATED DICE ROLL WITH ARRAYS

  As  you  begin  writing  more  complex  programs,   you'll   find  that
subscripted  variables  cut  down  on  the  number of statements and make
programs simpler to write.
  For example, a single subscripted variable can keep track of the number
of times each face on a die turns up in a dice roll:

   1 REM DICE SIMULATION: PRINT CHR$(147)
  10 INPUT &quot;HOW MANY ROLLS: &quot;; X
  20 FOR L = 1 TO X
  30 R = INT(6*RND(1)) + 1
  40 F(R) = F(R) + 1
  50 NEXT L
  60 PRINT &quot;FACE&quot;, &quot;NUMBER OF TIMES&quot;
  70 FOR C = 1 TO 6: PRINT C, F(C): NEXT

  Line 10 asks you  how many times you'll throw the dice in the simulated
roll.
  Line 20  sets  up  a loop to count the number of dice rolls so that the
program ends on the Xth roll.
  Line 30 makes R equal to the random number rolled.
  Line 40  sets up the array F,  for FACE,  which keeps track of how many
times  each  face  turns  up.  Whatever value R acquires in the dice roll
becomes  the  subscript  for  the  array,  and  line  40  adds one to the
appropriate array variable.  For example,  every time a 2 is thrown, F(2)
is increased by one.
  Line 70 PRINTs the number of times each face shows up.  Here's a sample
RUN:

  HOW MANY ROLLS: ? 1000
  FACE       NUMBER OF TIMES
   1          148
   2          176
   3          178
   4          166
   5          163
   6          169

  Now we'll show you how much longer your program would be  if you didn't
use an array:

  10 INPUT &quot;HOW MANY ROLLS: &quot;; X
  20 FOR L = 1 TO X
  30 R = INT(6*RND(1)) + 1
  40 IF R = 1 THEN F1 = F1 + 1: NEXT
  41 IF R = 2 THEN F2 = F2 + 1: NEXT
  42 IF R = 3 THEN F3 = F3 + 1: NEXT
  43 IF R = 4 THEN F4 = F4 + 1: NEXT
  44 IF R = 5 THEN F5 = F5 + 1: NEXT
  45 IF R = 6 THEN F6 = F6 + 1: NEXT
  60 PRINT &quot;FACE&quot;, &quot;NUMBER OF TIMES&quot;
  70 PRINT 1, F1
  71 PRINT 2, F2
  72 PRINT 3, F3
  73 PRINT 4, F4
  74 PRINT 5, F5
  75 PRINT 6, F6

  As  you  can see,  the program has twice as many lines.  The longer the
program, the more space and time you can save when you use arrays.


9.6. TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS

  As  we  mentioned  before,  two-dimensional  arrays  have both rows and
columns,  like  a  chart  or  a  table.  Two-dimensional  arrays have two
subscripts:  the  first one is for the ROW number;  the second is for the
COLUMN number. For example:

        A(4,6) has 4 ROWS
               and 6 COLUMNS

  Here's  what  array  A  would  look  like  as a two-dimensional grid in
memory:

  You'll notice  that  there's  a  zeroth  row  and  column,  so when you
DIMension A(4,6),  you're creating an array with 5 rows and 7 columns, or
35 elements.
  You  can access any element of a two-dimensional array by using its row
and  column  subscripts.  For example,  suppose you want to assign 255 to
A(3,4):

                           10 LET A(3,4) = 255

  Here's what the grid looks like now:

             0       1       2       3       4       5       6
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    0    |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    1    |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    2    |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    3    |       |       |       |       |  255  |       |       |
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    4    |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

  Two-dimensional arrays follow the same rules as one-dimensional arrays:

  DIMensioning:                         DIM A(20,20)
  Assigning data values:                A(1,1) = 255
  Assign values to other variables:     AB = A(1,1)
  PRINTing values:                      PRINT A(1,1)

  Here's  an  example  of  how  two-dimensional arrays can be used.  This
example keeps track of responses to a club questionnaire like this:

                            CLUB QUESTIONNAIRE

                 Q1: ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF RESOLUTION #1?

                       1-YES   2-NO   3-UNDECIDED


  Lets suppose there are four questions,  so the array,  which we'll call
A, will be DIMensioned A(4,3). Here's how the array table looks:

                          YES               NO           UNDECIDED

                   +----------------+----------------+----------------+
  QUESTION 1       |                |                |                |
                   +----------------+----------------+----------------+
  QUESTION 2       |                |                |                |
                   +----------------+----------------+----------------+
  QUESTION 3       |                |                |                |
                   +----------------+----------------+----------------+
  QUESTION 4       |                |                |                |
                   +----------------+----------------+----------------+

  The program that keeps track of the responses is on the next page. This
program  uses many of the programming techniques that have been presented
so far.
  Lines 30-65 PRINT the questions in numerical order and ask you to INPUT
the response.
  Line 70  adds one to the appropriate array element.  Remember that R is
the  question  number,  and the questions are in rows.  C is the response
number, and the responses are in columns.
  Line 90 asks if you have another set of responses to INPUT.
  Lines 110  and  120  tell  the  program where to go,  depending on your
response to line 90.
  Lines 130-170 PRINT the total number of each response.
  Each  time  you INPUT a response at line 61,  line 70 updates the right
element  of  the array.  Recall the R is the question number and C is the
response number, so if your response to question 2 is 3 (undecided), line
70 adds one to array element A(2,3).
  You'll  notice  that  we  didn't  use the zeroth row and column in this
example.  You  don't  have  to use this row and column, but remember that
they are always present in every array you use.

   20 PRINT &quot;{CLR/HOME}&quot;
   30 FOR R = 1 TO 4
   40 PRINT &quot;QUESTION # :&quot;; R

APPENDIX A

EXPANDING YOUR COMMODORE 64 COMPUTER SYSTEM


  The  64 is an extremely powerful computer and one that can be used in a
wide   variety   of   applications  from  word-processing  to  data  base
management.
  The  basic  64  computer  system  consists of the computer,  a suitable
television  set  or  monitor  and  a cassette unit on which to store your
programs.  For some applications, the cassette unit can be somewhat slow.
This  limitation  can be overcome by using a disk unit to save and recall
your programs.

Why Use a Disk Drive?

  If your programs or data files are very small,  storing  information on
cassette tape will not cause any great inconvenience. However, there will
come  a  time  when the effective use of your system is restricted by the
time  it takes to load from and/or save to tape.  This is when you should
be thinking about using a Commodore disk unit.

THE VIC 1541 DISK DRIVE

 The  VIC  1541 disk drive allows you to store up to 144 programs or data
files on a standard 5-1/4 inch diskette.  When using a disk drive, you no
longer  have  to  think about re-winding tapes or worry about overwriting
existing information. The 1541 disk unit is an 'intelligent device', i.e.
it  does  its  own  processing  without  having  to use any of the memory
resources of the COMMODORE 64.  Over 174000 characters of information can
be stored on each diskette -- the size of an average Dicken's novel!  The
main  advantage  of  a  disk  drive  over  a  cassette  unit is speed. An
operation  on  a  disk  drive is typically up to 40 times faster than the
same  operation  on cassette.  The VIC 1541 disk unit requires no special
interface -- it plugs directly to your COMMODORE 64.
  You are not restricted to using one disk drive. By connecting the units
together  (called  'daisy-chaining')  as  many as five disk drives can be
used  with  one  COMMODORE 64  so that you can load and save programs and
files without having to change diskettes.

VIC 1525 DOT MATRIX PRINTER

  A printer adds a great deal of versatility to your computer system.  No
computer  system  is  complete  without  one.  It  allows  you to produce
invoices,  send  letters,  or  print out program listings so that you can
examine your code away from the computer.  The VIC 1525 is a 'dot matrix'
printer. This means that each character is made up from a pattern of dots
in a grid. You can print all the characters on your COMMODORE 64 keyboard
or print characters you have designed yourself.  The VIC 1525 prints at a
speed of 30 characters/second at 12 characters/inch on plain tractor-feed
paper  up  to  10  inches  wide.  The  printer  plugs  directly into your
COMMODORE 64 and requires no additional interface.

VIC 1526 BI-DIRECTIONAL DOT MATRIX PRINTER

  The  VIC  1526  printer  differs  from  the  VIC  1525 in two important
respects.  First,  it  is  a bi-directional printer.  This means that the
machine  prints  from  right  to left as well as the conventional left to
right. This means that the machine doesn't waste time sending the printer
head to the left edge of the paper every time a new line of text is to be
printed.
  The  second  main  difference  between the 1526 and 1525 is in speed of
operation.  The time taken to print each line is directly proportional to
the  width  of page you have set up.  On an 80 column wide print out, the
speed is  45  lines/minute;  on  40 columns,  78 lines/minute,  and on 20
column wide paper, 124 lines/minute. The 1526 allows you to print up to 3
copies  of your output including the original.  It has a cartridge ribbon
for ease of interchange and accepts paper up to 10 inches wide.  The 1526
plugs directly to your COMMODORE 64 -- no special interface is required.

VIC 1520 PRINTER/PLOTTER

  The  VIC 1520 can be used both as a standard printer or as a plotter to
allow you to design and draw graphs,  histograms,  pie charts --  in fact
any  shape you like in a combination of four colors.  You can print upper
case/lower case letters and graphics symbols.  A further facility offered
by  the  printer  allows  you  to  define  the size of each character you
display.  The  printer  prints at 14 characters/second.  Depending on the
size  of character selected,  between 10 and 40 characters can be printed
on  each line of the paper.  Characters can even be printed 'sideways' by
rotating them 90 degrees. Shapes are drawn by simply telling the printer/
plotter  where  the  start and end co-ordinates or the shape are to be on
the  paper and what type of line you wish to use.  These range from solid
lines to coarse, broken lines. The plotter is accurate to 0.2 of a mm and
has a plotting speed of 60 mm/sec. The plotter uses small ball-point pens
each of which is user-selectable when plotting. The printer/plotter plugs
directly into your COMMODORE 64 and requires no additional interface.

1701 COLOR MONITOR

  A  computer  with the versatility of the COMMODORE 64 needs a medium on
which to demonstrate its capabilities to the full. The 1701 color monitor
has  been  designed  specifically for this purpose.  The monitor has a 14
inch  screen  with outstanding resolution.  Sound can be generated either
from  the  monitor's  internal speaker or,  via a simple connection, from
your Hi-Fi system.

1311 JOYSTICK

  A  joystick  can be used not only as a games controller but also,  with
suitable software,  as a tool for drawing and plotting.  The COMMODORE 64
Programmer's  Reference  Guide  gives  detailed  information  on  how  to
incorporate the use of a joystick in your programs.


SOFTWARE

  A  wide  variety of software is available for the COMMODORE 64 covering
applications  in  the  home,  at  work,  entertainment  and  aids for the
programmer.


Software for Business and the Home

EASYFILE EFI 6440 (diskette)

  EASYFILE  is  a comprehensive data-base system for the COMMODORE 64. It
includes  all  the  features  of  similar,  highly-priced  packages  at a
fraction  of the cost.  The user decides how he wishes his information to
appear  when it is printed out either on the screen or the printer.  This
means  that  EASYFILE can be tailored to suit the needs of a wide variety
of applications either in business or in the home.

CLUB MANAGER CMG 6440 (diskette)

  CLUB  MANAGER  has been designed to aid in the smooth running of sports
clubs,  social clubs, associations -- in fact any organization that needs
to maintain accurate membership records. The package allows you to record
the details of all the members of your club on diskette,  much as records
are  stored  within  a filing cabinet.  Membership details can be amended
where  necessary  and  records  can  be  added  to  or  deleted  from the
membership  file.  CLUB MANAGER  enables you to produce membership lists,
subscription reminders,  address labels,  and, because the package can be
linked to the EASY SCRIPT word processor, personalized copies of standard
letters.  CLUB MANAGER  also has a booking facility allowing you to enter
details of when members wish to use squash courts, tennis courts, snooker
tables,  restaurant tables, dance tickets or any similar club facility or
activity. Overbooking is now a thing of the past. CLUB MANAGER allows you
to  maintain  a diary and use it to record/amend details of appointments,
meetings,  etc.  CLUB MANAGER is an ideal tool for the club owner or club
secretary and will greatly reduce the amount of time spent on maintaining
membership records and booking club facilities.

FUTURE FINANCE FFI 6440 (diskette)

  FUTURE FINANCE  is a low-cost,  financial planning package.  It enables
you  to  predict  your  company's  profit and cash-flow position based on
expected production, sales and costs.  Details can be altered to view the
effect of these changes on the company's overall performance. Reports can
be  produced showing the contribution to profits made by each product and
the cash-flow position at the end of each user-defined period.

EASYCALC ECL 6440 (diskette)

  EASYCALC  is  an  electronic  spreadsheet package.  It contains all the
traditional spreadsheet features -- user-defined sheet size,  replication
of  information  from  one area of the sheet to the other etc.  Allied to
these  facilities,  EASYCALC  includes  many  other  features including a
library  of trigonometrical,  statistical and other advanced mathematical
functions,  the  ability  to draw graphs in a specific area of the sheet,
data protection via a password option and much, much more.

EASY STOCK EST 6440 (diskette)

  EASY  STOCK  is  a powerful inventory system containing a wide range of
stock-recording  and  reporting features.  The details of each stock item
are entered directly from the keyboard onto the screen and then stored on
diskette. EASY STOCK also allows you to change the price of an individual
item  or  a  range  of  products on the stock file.  Each stock record is
accessed  by  simply  typing  in  the reference/part number of that item.
Records can be amended,  added to your stock file or deleted from it.  If
the amount of stock on hand falls below your specified minimum level, the
stock  figure  is  highlighted  when  the record is accessed.  EASY STOCK
allows  you  to  produce  a wide range of reports including stock levels,
analysis  of  stock  movements,  sales/stock  valuation analyses and much
more.

EASY SCRIPT ESC 6440 (diskette)

  EASY SCRIPT is a professional,  low cost,  word-processing package.  It
enables  you  to create,  modify and print text quickly and easily.  EASY
SCRIPT  can be used for writing letters, reports, memos, book manuscripts
--  in  fact  any  kind  of  document.  Text can be stored on diskette or
cassette so that it may be printed or modified as required.

EASY SPELL ESP 6440 (diskette)

  EASY SPELL  is a spelling checker for files produced by the EASY SCRIPT
word processing package.  It can be used to check text in individual EASY
SCRIPT  files  or  text  that  is spread over files that have been linked
together.  The  EASY  SPELL  package  comes  complete  with  a dictionary
diskette against which the spelling of text is checked.


Aids for the Programmer

  To  assist  in  the  development  of  your own software,  Commodore has
introduced  a  range of programming utilities.  These will help speed the
entry and debugging of BASIC and machine code programs.

SIMON'S BASIC SIB 6410 (cartridge)

  SIMON'S BASIC  has been designed to enable programmers of all levels to
easily  utilize  the  potential of their COMMODORE 64.  The SIMON'S BASIC
cartridge  is  really  three  packages  in one.  It contains a Toolkit to
remove  the  tedious  aspects  of  computer programming,  a vast range of
commands  to  facilitate  the  use  of  graphics  and sound on the 64 and
Structured  Programming  commands  to  help  the  programmer  write  more
meaningful  code.  The  package is supplied in cartridge form which means
that you can use all its features by simply inserting it into the slot at
the  rear  of  the  COMMODORE 64  and turning the computer on --  it's as
simple  as that.  You then use the additional SIMON'S BASIC commands just
as you would any other BASIC commands.

Toolkit commands include:

  o AUTO           - for automatic line numbering
  o RENUMBER       - for automatic program re-numbering
  o KEY            - to assign commands to the function keys

and many more.

Graphics commands include:

  o HIRES          - to put the screen into high-resolution mode
  o REC            - to draw a rectangular shape
  o CIRCLE         - to draw a circular shape
  o PAINT          - to fill a shape with color

plus commands for creating sprites and user-defined graphics:

  o DESIGN         - to set up a design grid for a sprite or user-defined
                     character
  o MMOB           - to move a sprite
  o DETECT         - to detect sprite collision

and much, much more.

  The  Structured-Programming  commands  supplied  by  the  SIMON'S BASIC
cartridge  are a boon to programmers of all levels of ability.  It is now
possible  to label BASIC routines and call these routines by name.  Other
structured-programming commands include:

  o PROC           - to label BASIC routines
  o CALL           - to pass execution to a routine
  o EXEC           - to pass execution to a routine and return from it
                     when the routine has been completed
  o REPEAT...UNTIL - to repeat a loop dependent on a condition test

and many others.

  SIMON'S BASIC  also includes commands for screen formatting,  scrolling
the screen,  input validation, character string manipulation, hexadecimal
to  decimal and binary to decimal conversion,  integer division and much,
much more.  The cartridge also has a group of commands which allow you to
trap certain BASIC errors. You can even generate your own error messages!
The  range of commands supplied by the SIMON'S BASIC cartridge make it an
essential tool for any programmer who wants to easily utilize the special
features of his COMMODORE 64.
  Works with cassette or diskette.

ASSEMBLER TUTOR AST 6440 (diskette)  AST 6420 (cassette)

  The  ASSEMBLER  TUTOR  package  is a must for all would-be machine code
programmers.  It  can  also  be valuable to those programmers who already
know  something  about  assembly  language programming but wish to expand
their knowledge of 6502 machine code. The ASSEMBLER TUTOR is divided into
three  modules.  Each  module  covers  one  aspect  of  assembly-language
programming  and contains an introduction,  a self-test and discussion of
various aspects of assembly-language programming.

ASSEMBLER DEVELOPMENT ASM 6440 (diskette)

  The  ASSEMBLER  DEVELOPMENT  package allows you to program in assembler
directly onto your COMMODORE 64.  It provides all the tools the assembler
programmer  needs  to  create,  assemble  load  and execute 6510 assembly
language code.

PROGRAMMER'S UTILITIES UTL 6440 (diskette)

  The  PROGRAMMER'S  UTILITIES  package  contains many useful routines to
help  both  the  new  and experienced programmer to get the most from his
COMMODORE 64.  These  include  Disk-Handling  routines  for  changing the
device  number  of  a  disk  drive  and copying disks using a single disk
drive,  graphics utilities such as a sprite  and character editor,  sound
commands  and  BASIC  programming  aids  for easier screen formatting and
control operations.


ENTERTAINMENT

  As  well  as  a  wide  range  of top quality arcade-style games for the
COMMODORE 64, Commodore have also produced a range of Business Simulation
programs  for  those who prefer to exercise their brain rather than their
joystick fire button finger. In these games, time is no restriction, only
your capabilities to work out complex scenarios.

LABYRINTH LBY 6420 (cassette)

  Dare you enter the twisting Elizabethan maze? Will you ever get out, or
will  you  be  trapped forever?  LOST?  Well you can take a quick peek at
where you are but remember that this reduces your score. Certainly a game
to lose yourself in.

HIGH FLYER HFL 6440 (diskette)

  It's 1945.  The War has just ended and you have decided to run your own
airline.  By  making careful management decisions,  you have to guide the
enterprise  from 1945 up to the present day.  The decisions are all yours
-- plane schedules and routes;  what is the best cargo/passenger ratio to
maximize  profit;  when  is  the  best  time  to extend your fleet,  make
improvements to existing stock, enhance support services;  whether or not
you  need to borrow money from the hank and which banks can offer you the
best deal etc.  You can save the position you have reached until the next
time you wish to join the high-flyers.
  Available on diskette only.

RAIL BOSS RBO 6440 (diskette)

  You  are  a  pioneer  railwayman  in  charge  of building a line in the
American West between Base City and Junction City.  It's your job to hire
and fire surveyors,  workers and guards to protect you and your workforce
against marauding bandits.  By building stations along the route, you can
generate income to pay your workforce and buy additional stock should you
require it.  To thwart your efforts,  warlike Indians try to disrupt your
work  by killing members of the workforce and ripping up the track.  Your
only hope is that the cavalry from Fort Commodore can get to the  Indians
before they get to you. A game for budding pioneersmen everywhere.

OCEAN RACER OCR 6440 (diskette)

  You  have entered the round-the-world yacht race.  The race starts from
Portsmouth and goes via Cape Town South Africa, Auckland New Zealand, Rio
de Janeiro in Brazil  and,  finally,  back to Portsmouth.  You choose the
type of ship you wish to captain:  a single-masted cutter/sloop;  a twin-
masted  ketch  or  a  single-masted multi-hull boat.  The race is in four
stages,  each  of which contains various hazards ranging from icebergs to
boat damage caused by passing whales!  You decide which route to sail and
how  much  sail to select for the prevailing wind conditions.  A game for
old salts and aspiring mariners alike.

  These  are  just  the  first  of  a series of thinking games especially
designed for the COMMODORE 64. More are being developed all the time. For
details  of  release  dates,  please  keep in close touch with your local
Commodore stockist.



APPENDIX B

DESCRIPTION OF DOS ERROR MESSAGES


NOTE:  Error  message  numbers  less  than  20 should be ignored with the
exception  of  01  which  gives  information  about  the  number of files
scratched with the SCRATCH command.

20:  READ ERROR (block header not found)
     The  disk controller is unable to locate the header of the requested
     data block.  Caused  by an illegal sector number,  or the header has
     been destroyed.

21:  READ ERROR (no sync character)
     The  disk  controller is unable to detect a sync mark on the desired
     track.  Caused by misalignment of the read/writer head,  no diskette
     is present,  or unformatted or improperly seated diskette.  Can also
     indicate a hardware failure.

22:  READ ERROR (data block not present)
     The  disk  controller  has  been  requested to read or verify a data
     block  that  was not properly written.  This error message occurs in
     conjunction  with  the BLOCK commands and indicates an illegal track
     and/or block request.

23:  READ ERROR (checksum error in data block)
     This  error  message indicates that there is an error in one or more
     of the data bytes.  The data has been read into the DOS memory,  but
     the  checksum  over  the  data  is  in error.  This message may also
     indicate grounding problems.

24:  READ ERROR (byte decoding error)
     The data or header has been read into the DOS memory, but a hardware
     error  has  been  created  due to an invalid bit pattern in the data
     byte. This message may also indicate grounding problems.

25:  WRITE ERROR (write-verify error)
     This  message  is  generated  if  the  controller detects a mismatch
     between the written data and the data in the DOS memory.

26:  WRITE PROTECT ON
     This  message is generated when the controller has been requested to
     write  a  data  block  while  the write protect switch is depressed.
     Typically, this is caused by using a diskette with a write a protect
     tab over the notch.

27:  READ ERROR (checksum error in header)
     The controller has detected an  error in the header of the requested
     data block.  The block has not  been  read into the DOS memory. This
     message may also indicate grounding problems.

28:  WRITE ERROR (long data block)
     The  controller  attempts to detect the sync mark of the next header
     after writing a data block.  If the sync mark does not appear within
     a predetermined time,  the error message is generated.  The error is
     caused  by  a  bad  diskette format  (the data extends into the next
     block), or by hardware failure.

29:  DISK ID MISMATCH
     This  message is generated when the controller has been requested to
     access  a  diskette which has not been initialized.  The message can
     also occur if a diskette has a bad header.

30:  SYNTAX ERROR (general syntax)
     The  DOS  cannot  interpret the command sent to the command channel.
     Typically,  this  is  caused by an illegal number of file names,  or
     patterns are illegally used.  For example, two file names may appear
     on the left side of the COPY command.

31:  SYNTAX ERROR (invalid command)
     The  DOS  does not recognize the command.  The command must start in
     the first position.

32:  SYNTAX ERROR (invalid command)
     The command sent is longer than 58 characters.

33:  SYNTAX ERROR (invalid file name)
     Pattern matching is invalidly used in the OPEN or SAVE command.

34:  SYNTAX ERROR (no file given)
     The  file  name  was  left  out  of  a  command  or the DOS does not
     recognize  it as such.  Typically,  a colon (:) has been left out of
     the command.

39:  SYNTAX ERROR (invalid command)
     This  error  may  result  if  the  command  sent  to command channel
     (secondary address 15) is unrecognized by the DOS.

50:  RECORD NOT PRESENT
     Result of disk reading past the last record through INPUT#,  or GET#
     commands. This message will also occur after positioning to a record
     beyond  end  of file in a relative file.  If the intent is to expand
     the file by adding the new record (with a PRINT# command), the error
     message may be ignored.  INPUT  or GET should not be attempted after
     this error is detected without first repositioning.

51:  OVERFLOW IN RECORD
     PRINT# statement exceeds record boundary.  Information is truncated.
     Since  the  carriage  return which is sent as a record terminator is
     counted  in  the  record size,  this message will occur if the total
     characters  in  the  record  (including  the  final carriage return)
     exceeds the defined size.

52:  FILE TOO LARGE
     Record  position within a relative file indicates that disk overflow
     will result.

60:  WRITE FILE OPEN
     This message is generated when a write file that has not been closed
     is being opened for reading.

61:  FILE NOT OPEN
     This message is generated when a file is being accessed that has not
     been opened in the DOS.  Sometimes,  in this case,  a message is not
     generated; the request is simply ignored.

62:  FILE NOT FOUND
     The requested file does not exist on the indicated drive.

63:  FILE EXISTS
     The  file  name  of  the  file  being  created already exists on the
     diskette.

64:  FILE TYPE MISMATCH
     The  file  type  does not match the file type in the directory entry
     for the requested file.

65:  NO BLOCK
     This  message  occurs  in  conjunction  with  the  B-A  command.  It
     indicates  that  the  block  to  be  allocated  has  been previously
     allocated.  The  parameters  indicate the track and sector available
     with the next highest number.  If the parameters are zero (0),  then
     all blocks higher in number are in use.

66:  ILLEGAL TRACK AND SECTOR
     The  DOS  has  attempted  to  access a track or block which does not
     exist in the format being used.  This may indicate a problem reading
     the pointer to the next block.

67:  ILLEGAL SYSTEM T OR S
     This  special  error  message  indicates  an illegal system track or
     block.

70:  NO CHANNEL (available)
     The requested channel is not available,  or all channels are in use.
     A  maximum of five sequential files may be opened at one time to the
     DOS. Direct access channels may have six opened files.

71:  DIRECTORY ERROR
     The BAM does not match the internal count. There is a problem in the
     BAM  allocation  or  the BAM has been overwritten in DOS memory.  To
     correct  this problem,  reinitialize the diskette to restore the BAM
     in  memory.  Some  active  files may be terminated by the corrective
     action. NOTE: BAM = Block Availability Map.

72:  DISK FULL
     Either  the  blocks  on the diskette are used or the directory is at
     its entry limit.  DISK FULL is sent when two blocks are available on
     the 1541 to allow the current file to be closed.

73:  DOS MISMATCH (73, CBM DOS V2.6 1541)
     DOS 1 and 2 are read compatible but not write compatible.  Disks may
     be interchangeably read with either DOS, but a disk formatted on one
     version  cannot  be  written upon with the other version because the
     format is different.  This error is displayed whenever an attempt is
     made  to  write  upon  a  disk  which  has  been formatted in a non-
     compatible  format.  (A  utility  routine  is available to assist in
     converting from one format to another.) This message may also appear
     after power up.

74:  DRIVE NOT READY
     An attempt has been made to access the 1541 single Drive Floppy Disk
     without any diskettes present in either drive.



APPENDIX C

COMMODORE 64 BASIC


  This  manual  has  given  you  an introduction to the BASIC language --
enough  for  you  to  get a feel for computer programming and some of the
vocabulary  involved.  This  appendix  gives a complete list of the rules
(SYNTAX) of 64 BASIC, along with concise descriptions.  Please experiment
with  these  commands.  Remember,  you  can't damage the computer by just
typing  in  programs,   and  the  best  way  to  learn  computing  is  by
experimenting.
  This  appendix  is  divided  into  sections  according to the different
types of operations in BASIC. These include:

1. Variables  and  Operators:  describes the different type of variables,
   legal variable names, and arithmetic and logical operators.
2. Commands:  describes the commands used to work with programs,  such as
   editing, storing and erasing.
3. Statements:  describes  the  BASIC program statements used in numbered
   lines of programs.
4. Functions: describes the string, numeric, and print functions.


VARIABLES

  The Commodore 64 uses three types of variables in BASIC. These are real
numeric, integer numeric, and string (alphanumeric) variables.
  Variable  names may consist of a single letter,  a letter followed by a
number, or two letters.
  An  integer  variable  is specified by using the percent (%) sign after
the  variable name.  String variable have the dollar sign ($) after their
name.

Examples

  Real Variable Names: A, A5, BZ
  Integer Variable Names: A%, A5%, BZ%
  String Variable Names: A$, A5$, BZ$

  Arrays are lists of variables with the same name,  using numbers called
subscripts to specify the element of the array.  Arrays are defined using
the  DIM statement,  and may contain floating point,  integer,  or string
variables.  The  array  variable name is followed by a set of parentheses
( ) enclosing the number of variables in the list.

  A(7), BZ%(11), A$(50), PT(20,20)

  NOTE:  There are three variable names which are reserved for use by the
64, and may not be defined by you.  These variables are:  ST, TI and TI$.
ST  is  a  status variable which relates to input/output operations.  The
value of ST will change if there is a problem loading a program from disk
or tape.
  TI and TI$ are variables which relate to the real-time clock built into
the 64. The variable TI is updated every 1/60th of a second. It starts at
0 when the computer is turned on, and is reset only by changing the value
of TI$.
  TI$  is a string which is constantly updated by the system.  The  first
two characters contain the number of hours,  the  3rd and 4th  characters
the number of minutes,  and  the 5th and 6th characters are the number of
seconds.  This  variable  can  be  given  any numeric value,  and will be
updated from that point.

  TI$ = &quot;101530&quot; sets the clock to 10:15 and 30 seconds AM.

  This clock is erased when the computer is turned  off,  and  starts  at
zero when the system is turned back on.


OPERATORS

  The arithmetic operators include the following signs:

  +  Addition
  -  Subtraction
  *  Multiplication
  /  Division
  ^  Raising to a power (exponentiation)

  On a line  containing  more than one operator,  there is a set order in
which operations always occur. If several operations are used together on
the  same  line,  the  computer  assigns  priorities  as follows:  First,
exponentiation. Next, multiplication and division, and last, addition and
subtraction.
  You  can change the order of operations by enclosing within parentheses
the calculation to be performed first. Operations enclosed in parentheses
will take place before other operations.
  There are also operations for equalities and inequalities:

  =  Equal To
  &lt;  Less Than
  &gt;  Greater Than
  &lt;= Less Than or Equal To
  &gt;= Greater Than or Equal To
  &lt;&gt; Not Equal To

  Finally, there are three logical operators:

  AND
  OR
  NOT

  These are used most  often  to  join  multiple  formulas  in  IF...THEN
statements. For example:

  IF A=B AND C=D THEN 100  (Requires both parts to be true)
  IF A=B OR  C=D THEN 100  (Allows either part to be true)


COMMANDS

CONT (Continue)

  This command is used to restart the execution of a  program  which  has
been stopped by either using the &lt;STOP&gt; key (but not &lt;STOP&gt; &amp; &lt;RESTORE&gt;),
a  STOP  statement,  or an END statement within the program.  The program
will restart at the exact place from where it left off.
  CONT will not work if you have changed or added lines to  the  program,
or  if  the  program  halted  due to an error,  or if you caused an error
before trying to restart the program. In these cases you will get a CAN'T
CONTINUE ERROR.

LIST

  The  LIST  command  allows  you  to look at lines of a BASIC program in
memory.  You  can  ask  for  the  entire program to be displayed, or only
certain line numbers.

  LIST              Shows entire program
  LIST 10-          Shows only from line 10 until end
  LIST 10           Shows only line 10
  LIST -10          Shows lines from beginning until 10
  LIST 10-20        Shows line from 10 to 20, inclusive

LOAD

  This  command  is  used  to  transfer  a program from tape or disk into
memory  so  the  program  can  be  used.  If  you  just type LOAD and hit
&lt;RETURN&gt;,  the first program found on the cassette unit will be placed in
memory.  The  command  may  be followed by a program name enclosed within
quotes.  The name may then be followed by a comma and a number or numeric
variable,  which acts as a device number to indicate where the program is
coming from.
  If no device number is given, the COMMODORE 64 assumes device #1, which
is  the  cassette  unit.  The  other  device  commonly used with the LOAD
command is the disk device, which is device #8.

  LOAD              Reads in the next program on tape
  LOAD &quot;HELLO&quot;      Searches tape for program called HELLO,
                      and loads program if found
  LOAD A$           Looks for program whose name is in the variable A$
  LOAD &quot;HELLO&quot;,8    Looks for program called HELLO on the disk drive
  LOAD &quot;*&quot;,8        Looks for first program on disk

  A  secondary  address  of  1  must  be  specified if you want to load a
machine code program without relocating it.

  LOAD &quot;M/C PROGRAM&quot;,1,1  Loads machine code from tape without relocating

NEW

  This  command erases the entire program in memory,  and also clears out
any variables that may have been used.  Unless the program was SAVEd,  it
is lost. BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THIS COMMAND.
  The NEW command can also be used as a BASIC program statement. When the
program reaches this line,  the program is erased.  This is useful if you
want to leave everything neat when the program is done.

RUN

  This command causes execution of a program,  once the program is loaded
into memory.  If there is no line number following RUN, the computer will
start  with the lowest line number.  If a line number is designated,  the
program will start executing from the specified line.

  RUN               Starts program at lowest line number
  RUN 100           Starts execution at line 100
  RUN X             UNDEFINED STATEMENT ERROR. You must always specify an
                    actual line number, not a variable representation

SAVE

  This  command will store the program currently in memory on cassette or
disk.  If  you just type SAVE and &lt;RETURN&gt;,  the program will be SAVEd on
cassette.  The  computer  has  no  way  of  knowing if there is a program
already  on  that tape,  so be careful with your tapes or you may erase a
valuable program.
  If you type SAVE followed by a name in quotes or a string variable, the
computer  will  give  the  program  that  name,  so it can be more easily
located  and retrieved in the future.  The name may also be followed by a
device number.
  After  the  device  number,  there  can be a comma and a second number,
either  0 or 1.  If the second number is 1,  the COMMODORE 64 will put an
END-OF-TAPE  marker after your program.  This signals the computer not to
look  any  further  on  the  tape  if you were to give an additional LOAD
command. If you try to LOAD a program and the computer finds one of these
markers, you will get a FILE NOT FOUND ERROR.

  SAVE              Stores program to tape without name
  SAVE &quot;HELLO&quot;      Stores on tape with name HELLO
  SAVE A$           Stores on tape with name A$
  SAVE &quot;HELLO&quot;,8    Stores on disk with name HELLO
  SAVE &quot;HELLO&quot;,1,1  Stores on tape with name HELLO and reloads in same
                      position of memory
  SAVE &quot;HELLO&quot;,1,2  Stores on tape with name HELLO and follows program
                      with END-OF-TAPE marker
  SAVE &quot;HELLO&quot;,1,3  As above but reloads in same position of memory

VERIFY

  This  command  causes the computer to check the program on disk or tape
against  the  one  in memory.  This is proof that the program is actually
SAVEd,  in  case the tape or disk is bad,  or something went wrong during
the SAVE.  VERIFY without anything after the command causes the COMMODORE
64  to  check the next program on tape,  regardless of name,  against the
program in memory.
  VERIFY  followed by a program name,  or a string variable,  will search
for that program and then check. Device numbers can also be included with
the verify command.

  VERIFY            Checks the next program on tape
  VERIFY &quot;HELLO&quot;    Searches for HELLO, checks against memory
  VERIFY &quot;HELLO&quot;,8  Searches for HELLO on disk, then checks

  To  check  if  a  program  is  already  on a tape,  just VERIFY and the
computer will say which program it has found (if any).


STATEMENTS

CLOSE

  This  command  completes  and closes any files used by OPEN statements.
The number following CLOSE is the file number to be closed.

  CLOSE 2           Only file #2 is closed

CLR

  This command will erase any variables in memory, but leaves the program
itself intact.  This command is automatically executed when a RUN command
is given.

CMD

  CMD sends the output which normally would go to the screen (i.e., PRINT
statements,  LISTs,  but  not  POKEs  onto the screen)  to another device
instead.  This could be a printer, or a data file on disk. This device or
file  must be OPENed first.  The CMD command must be followed by a number
or numeric variable referring to the file.

  OPEN 1,4          OPENs device #4, which is the printer
  CMD 1             All normal output now goes to printer
  LIST              The program listing now goes to the printer, not the
                    screen

  To send output back to the screen, CLOSE the file with CLOSE 1.

DATA

  This  statement  is  followed  by  a  list  of items to be used by READ
statements.  Items  may  be numeric values or text strings, and items are
separated  by commas.  String items need not be inside quote marks unless
they contain space,  colon, or comma.  If two commas have nothing between
them, the value will be READ as a zero for a number, or an empty string.

  DATA 12, 14.5, &quot;HELLO, MOM&quot;, 3.14, PART1

DEF FN

  This  command  allows you to define a complex calculation as a function
with a short name.  In the case of a long formula that is used many times
within the program, this can save time and space.
  This  function  name  will  be  FN and any legal variable name  (1 or 2
characters long).  First you must define the function using the statement
DEF  followed  by  the  function  name.  Following  the  name is a set of
parentheses enclosing a numeric variable. Then follows the actual formula
that  you want to define,  with the variable in the proper spot.  You can
then &quot;call&quot; the formula, substituting any number for the variable.

  10 DEF FN A(X) = 12 * ( 34.75 - X / .3 )
  20 PRINT FN A(7)                ^
                ^                 |
                |                 |   7 is inserted where
                +-----------------+   X is in the formula

For this example, the result would be 137.

DIM

  When you use more than 11 elements of an array,  you must execute a DIM
statement for the array.  Keep in mind that the whole array takes up room
in  memory,  so  don't  create an array much larger than you'll need.  To
figure  the  number  of  variables  created with DIM,  multiply the total
number of elements plus one in each dimension of the array.

  10 DIM A$(40), B7(15), CC%(4,4,4)
             ^       ^         ^
             |       |         |
   41 elements  16 elements  125 elements

  You can dimension more than one array in a DIM statement.  However,  be
careful not to dimension an array more than once.

END

  When a program encounters an END statement, the program halts, as if it
ran out of lines. You may use CONT to restart the program.

FOR ... TO ... STEP

  This statement works with the NEXT statement to repeat a section of the
program a set number of times. The format is:

  FOR (Var. Name)=(Start of Count) TO (End of Count) STEP (Count By)

  The  loop  variable  will  be  added  to  or subtracted from during the
program.  Without any STEP specified,  STEP is assumed to be 1. The start
count and end count are the limits to the value of the loop variable.

  10 FOR L = 1 TO 10 STEP .1
  20 PRINT L
  30 NEXT L

  The end of the loop value may be followed by the word STEP  and another
number or variable.  In this case, the value following STEP is added each
time instead of 1. This allows you to count backwards, or by fractions.

GET

  The  GET  statement  allows  you  to  get  data from the keyboard,  one
character at a time. When GET is executed, the character that is typed is
assigned to the variable.  If no character is typed,  then a null (empty)
character is assigned.
  GET  is  followed by a variable name,  usually a string variable.  If a
numeric  variable  was  used and a nonnumeric key depressed,  the program
would halt with an error message.  The GET statement may be placed into a
loop, checking for any empty result.  This loop will continue until a key
is hit.

  10 GET A$: IF A$ = &quot;&quot; THEN 10

GET#

  The GET# statement is used with a previously OPENed device or file,  to
input one character at a time from that device or file.

  GET#1,A$

This would input one character from a data file.

GOSUB

  This statement is similar to GOTO,  except the computer remembers which
program line it last executed before the GOSUB. When a line with a RETURN
statement  is  encountered,  the  program  jumps  back  to  the statement
immediately following the GOSUB.  This is useful if there is a routine in
your  program  that  occurs  in several parts of the program.  Instead of
typing the routine over and over, execute GOSUBs each time the routine is
needed.

  20 GOSUB 800

GOTO or GO TO

  When a statement with the GOTO command is reached,  the next line to be
executed will be the one with the line number following the word GOTO.

IF ... THEN

  IF ... THEN lets the computer analyze a situation and take two possible
courses of action,  depending on the outcome.  If the expression is true,
the  statement  following  THEN  is  executed.  This  may  be  any  BASIC
statement.
  If the expression is false, the program goes directly to the next line.
  The expression being evaluated may be a variable or formula,  in  which
case it is considered true if nonzero,  and false if zero.  In most cases,
there  is an expression involving relational operators  (=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=,
&lt;&gt;, AND, OR, NOT).

  10 IF X &gt; 10 THEN END

INPUT

  The  INPUT  statement  allows  the  program  to get data from the user,
assigning  that  data  to  a  variable.  The  program will stop,  print a
question  mark  (?)  on the screen,  and wait for the user to type in the
answer and hit &lt;RETURN&gt;.
  INPUT  is  followed  by  a variable name,  or a list of variable names,
separated by commas.  A message may be placed within quote marks,  before
the  list of variable names to be INPUT.  If more than one variable is to
be INPUT, they must be separated by commas when typed.

  10 INPUT &quot;PLEASE ENTER YOUR FIRST NAME&quot;;A$
  20 PRINT &quot;ENTER YOUR CODE NUMBER&quot;;: INPUT B

INPUT#

  INPUT#  is  similar  to INPUT,  but takes data from a previously OPENed
file.

  10 INPUT#1, A

LET

  LET  is  hardly  ever used in programs,  since it is optional,  but the
statement is the heart of all BASIC programs.  The variable name which is
to  be  assigned  the  result of a calculation is on the left side of the
equal sign, and the formula on the right.

  10 LET A = 5
  20 LET D$ = &quot;HELLO&quot;

NEXT

  NEXT  is  always  used in conjunction with the FOR statement.  When the
program  reaches a NEXT statement,  it checks the FOR statement to see if
the limit of the loop has been reached.  If the loop is not finished, the
loop  variable  is increased by the specified STEP value.  If the loop is
finished, execution proceeds with the statement following NEXT.
  NEXT  may  be  followed by a variable name,  or list of variable names,
separated by commas.  If there are no names listed, the last loop started
is the one being completed. If variables are given, they are completed in
order from left to right.

  10 FOR X = 1 TO 100: NEXT

ON

  This command turns the GOTO and GOSUB commands into special versions of
the IF statement. ON is followed by a formula, which is evaluated. If the
result of the calculation is one, the first line on the list is executed;
if the result is 2, the second line is executed, and so on. If the result
is 0,  negative,  or  larger  than  the  list  of numbers,  the next line
executed will be the statement following the ON statement.

  10 INPUT X
  20 ON X GOTO 10,20,30,40,50

OPEN

  Then  OPEN  statement allows the COMMODORE 64 to access devices such as
the disk for data, a printer,  or even the screen.  OPEN is followed by a
number  (0-255),  to which all following statements will refer.  There is
usually a second number after the first, which is the device number.
  The device numbers are:

  0   Screen
  1   Cassette
  4   Printer
  8   Disk

  Following the device number may be a third number, separated again by a
a comma, which is the secondary address.
  In the case of the disk,  the number refers to the buffer,  or channel,
number.  In  the  printer,  the  secondary address controls features like
expanded printing. See the Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Manual for
more details.

  OPEN 1,0           OPENs the SCREEN as a device
  OPEN 2,8,8,&quot;D&quot;     OPENs the disk for reading,
                       file to be searched for is D
  OPEN 3,4           OPENs the printer
  OPEN 4,8,15        OPENs the data channel on the disk

  Also see: CLOSE, CMD, GET#, INPUT#, and PRINT#, system variable ST, and
Appendix B.

POKE

  POKE is always followed by two numbers, or formulas. The first location
is a memory location; the second number is a decimal value from 0 to 255,
which  will  be  placed in the memory location,  replacing any previously
stored value.

  10 POKE 53281,0
  20 S = 4096 * 13
  30 POKE S + 29,8

PRINT

  The  PRINT  statement  is the  first one most people learn to use,  but
there  are  a  number of variations to be aware of. PRINT can be followed
by:

  Text String with quotes
  Variable names
  Functions
  Punctuation marks

  Punctuation  marks are used to help format the data on the screen.  The
comma   divides  the  screen  into  four  columns,  while  the  semicolon
suppresses  all  spacing.  Either  mark can be the last symbol on a line.
This  results  in  the  next  thing  PRINTed  acting  as  if  it  were  a
continuation of the same PRINT statement.

  10 PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot;
  20 PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot;, A$
  30 PRINT A + B
  40 PRINT J;
  50 PRINT A,B,C,D

  Also see: POS, SPC and TAB functions.

PRINT#

  There are a few differences between this statement and PRINT. PRINT# is
followed by a number,  which refers to the device or data file previously
OPENed.  This number is followed by a comma and a list to be printed. The
comma and semicolon have the same effect as they do in PRINT. Please note
that some devices may not work with TAB and SPC.

  100 PRINT#1, &quot;DATA VALUES&quot;; A%, B1, C$

READ

  READ  is  used to assign information from DATA statements to variables,
so the information may be put to use. Care must be taken to avoid READing
strings where READ is expecting a number, which will give a TYPE MISMATCH
ERROR.

REM  (Remark)

  REMark  is a note to whomever is reading a LIST of the program.  It may
explain  a section of the program,  or give additional instructions.  REM
statements  in no way affect the operation of the program,  except to add
to its length. REM may be followed by any text.

RESTORE

  When  executed  in  a  program,  the pointer to which an item in a DATA
statement will be READ next is reset to the first item in the list.  This
gives  you  the  ability  to  re-READ the information.  RESTORE stands by
itself on a line.

RETURN

  This  statement  is  always  used  in conjunction with GOSUB.  When the
program  encounters  a  RETURN,  it  will go to the statement immediately
following the GOSUB command.  If no GOSUB was previously issued, a RETURN
WITHOUT GOSUB ERROR will occur.

STOP

  This statement will halt program execution.  The message,  BREAK IN xxx
will  be  displayed,  where  xxx is the line number containing STOP.  The
program may be restarted by using the CONT command. STOP is normally used
in debugging a program.

SYS

  SYS  is  followed  by  a  decimal  number or numeric value in the range
0-65535.  The  program  will  then  begin  executing the machine language
program  starting  at  that  memory location.  This is similar to the USR
function, but does not allow parameter passing.

WAIT

  WAIT  is  used  to  halt  the  program  until  the contents of a memory
location changes in a specific way. WAIT is followed by a memory location
(X) and up to two variables. The format is:

  WAIT X,Y,Z

  The  contents  of the memory location are first exclusive-ORed with the
third  number,  if  present,  and  then  logically  ANDed with the second
number.  If  the  result  is  zero,  the program goes back to that memory
location  and  checks  again.  When  the  result  is nonzero, the program
continues with the next statement.


NUMERIC FUNCTIONS

ABS(X)  (absolute value)

  ABS  returns  the absolute value of the number,  without its sign (+ or
-). The answer is always positive.

ATN(X)  (arctangent)

  Returns the angle, measured in radians, whose tangent is X.

COS(X)  (cosine)

  Returns  the  value of the cosine of X, where X is an angle measured in
radians.

EXP(X)

  Returns the value of the mathematical constant e (2.71828183) raised to
the power of X.

FN xx(X)

  Returns  the  value  of  the  user-defined function xx created in a DEF
FN xx(X) statement.

INT(X)

  Returns the truncated value of X, that is,  with all the decimal places
to the right of the decimal point removed. The result will always be less
than, or equal to, X. Thus, any negative numbers with decimal places will
become the integer less than their current value.

LOG(X)  (logarithm)

  Will  return  the natural log of X.  The natural log to the base e (see
EXP(X)). To convert to log base 10, simply divide by LOG(10).

PEEK(X)

  Used  to  find  out  contents  of  memory  location  X,  in  the  range
0-65535,  giving  a result from 0-255.  PEEK is often used in conjunction
with the POKE statement.

RND(X)  (random number)

  RND(X)  returns  a  random  number  in  the range 0-1. The first random
number  should be generated by the formula  RND(-TI)  to start things off
differently  every  time.  After  this,  X  should be a 1 or any positive
number.  If  X is zero,  the result will be the same random number as the
last one.
  A negative value for X will  reseed the generator.  The use of the same
negative  number  for  X  will  result  in  the same sequence of &quot;random&quot;
numbers.
  The formula for generating a number between X and Y is:

  N = RND(1) * (Y-X) + X

where,
  Y is the upper limit,
  X is the lower range of numbers desired.

SGN(X)  (sign)

  This function returns the sign (positive, negative, or zero) of X.  The
result will be +1 if positive, 0 if zero, and -1 if negative.

SIN(X)  (sine)

  SIN(X) is the trigonometric sine function.  The result will be the sine
of X, where X is an angle in radians.

SQR(X)  (square root)

  This  function will return the square root of X,  where X is a positive
number or 0. If X is negative, an ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR results.

TAN(X)  (tangent)

  The result will be the tangent of X, where X is an angle in radians.

USR(X)

  When  this  function  is used,  the program jumps to a machine language
program  whose  starting  point  is  contained  in memory locations.  The
parameter X is passed to the machine language program,  which will return
another  value  back  to  the  BASIC  program.  Refer to the Commodore 64
Programmer's Reference Manual  for  more  details  on  this  function and
machine language programming.


STRING FUNCTIONS

ASC(X$)

  This function will return the ASCII code of the first character of X$.

CHR$(X)

  This is the opposite of ASC, and returns a string character whose ASCII
code is X.

LEFT$(X$,X)

  Returns a string containing the leftmost X characters of X$.

LEN(X$)

  Returned will be the number of characters  (including  spaces and other
symbols) in the string X$.

MID$(X$,S,X)

  This will return a string containing X characters starting from the Sth
character in X$.

RIGHT$(X$,X)

  Returns the rightmost X characters in X$.

STR$(X)

  This will return a string  which is identical to the PRINTed version of
X.

VAL(X$)

  This function converts X$ into a number, and is essentially the inverse
operation  from STR$.  The string is examined from the leftmost character
to  the  right,  for  as  many  characters  as are in recognizable number
format.

  10 X = VAL(&quot;123.456&quot;)             X = 123.456
  10 X = VAL(&quot;12A13B&quot;)              X = 12
  10 X = VAL(&quot;RIU017&quot;)              X = 0
  10 X = VAL(&quot;-1.23.45.67&quot;)         X = -1.23


OTHER FUNCTIONS

FRE(X)

  This  function  returns the number of unused bytes available in memory,
regardless of the value of X.  Note that FRE(X) will read out in negative
numbers if the number of unused bytes is over 32K.

POS(X)

  This function returns the number of the column (0-39) at which the next
PRINT statement will begin on the screen. X may have any value and is not
used.

SPC(X)

  This is used in a PRINT statement to skip X spaces forward.

TAB(X)

  TAB is also used in a PRINT statement; the next item to be PRINTed will
be in column X.



APPENDIX D

ABBREVIATIONS FOR BASIC KEYWORDS


  As  a  time-saver  when  typing  in programs and commands, Commodore 64
BASIC  allows  the  user  to  abbreviate  most keywords. The abbreviation
for  PRINT  is  a  question  mark.  The abbreviations for other words are
made  by  typing  the  first  one or two letters of the word, followed by
the  SHIFTed  next  letter  of the word. If the abbreviations are used in
a program line, the keyword will LIST in the full form.

APPENDIX E

SCREEN DISPLAY CODES


  The  following  chart  lists  all  of  the  characters  built  into the
Commodore  64  character  sets.  It  shows  which numbers should be POKED
into  screen  memory  (locations  1024-2023)  to get a desired character.
Also  shown  is  which  character corresponds to a number PEEKed from the
screen.
  Two  character  sets  are  available,  but only one set at a time. This
means  that  you  cannot  have  characters  from one set on the screen at
the  same  time  you  have  characters  from the other set displayed. The
sets   are   switched   by   holding  down  the  &lt;SHIFT&gt;  and  &lt;C=&gt;  keys
simultaneously.
  From  BASIC,  POKE  53272,21  will  switch  to upper case mode and POKE
53272,23 switches to lower case.
  Any  number  on  the  chart  may  also  be  displayed  in  REVERSE. The
reverse  character  code  may  be  obtained  by  adding 128 to the values
shown.
  If  you  want  to  display  a  solid  circle at location 1504, POKE the
code for the circle (81) into location 1504: POKE 1504,81.
  There  is  a  corresponding  memory  location  to  control the color of
each  character  displayed  on  the  screen  (locations  55296-56295). To
change  the  color  of the circle to yellow (color code 7) you would POKE
the  corresponding  memory  location (55776) with the character color:
POKE 55776,7.
  Refer  to  Appendix  G  for  the complete screen and color memory maps,
along with color codes.

APPENDIX F

ASCII AND CHR$ CODES


  This  appendix  shows  you  what  characters  will  appear if you PRINT
CHR$(X),  for  all  possible  values  of  X. It will also show the values
obtained by typing PRINT ASC(&quot;x&quot;), where x is any character you can type.
This  is  useful in evaluating the character received in a GET statement,
converting upper/lower case,  and printing character based commands (like
switch to upper/lower case) that could not be enclosed in quotes.

CONVERTING STANDARD BASIC PROGRAMS TO COMMODORE 64 BASIC


  If  you  have  programs  written in a BASIC other than Commodore BASIC,
some  minor  adjustments  may  be  necessary  before  running them on the
Commodore 64. We've included some hints to make the conversion easier.

String Dimensions

  Delete all statements that are used to declare the length of strings. A
statement  such  as  DIM A$(I,J),  which  dimensions  a  string array for
J  elements  of  length  I,  should  be  converted to the Commodore BASIC
statement DIM A$(J).
  Some BASICs use a comma or an ampersand for string concatenation.  Each
of  these  must  be changed to a plus sign,  which is the Commodore BASIC
operator for string concatenation.
  In  Commodore-64  BASIC,  the  MID$,  RIGHT$,  and  LEFT$ functions are
used  to  take  substrings  of strings. Forms such as A$(I) to access the
Ith  character  in  A$,  or  A$(I,J)  to  take  a  substring  of  A$ from
position I to J, must be changed as follows:

Other BASIC     Commodore 64 BASIC

A$(I)=X$        A$=LEFT$(A$,I-1)+X$+MID$(A$,I+1)
A$(I,J)=X$      A$=LEFT$(A$,I-1)+X$+MID$(A$,J+1)

Multiple Assignments

  To set B and C equal to zero, some BASICs allow statements of the form:

10 LET B=C=0

  Commodore  64  BASIC would interpret the second equal sign as a logical
operator and set B = -1 if C = 0. Instead, convert this statement to:

10 C=0 : B=0

Multiple Statements

  Some  BASICs  use  a  backslash  to  separate  multiple statements on a
line. With Commodore 64 BASIC, separate all statements by a colon (:).

MAT Functions

  Programs  using  the  MAT  functions  available  on some BASICs must be
rewritten using FOR...NEXT loops to execute properly.



APPENDIX L

ERROR MESSAGES


  This   appendix   contains  a  complete  list  of  the  error  messages
generated by the Commodore-64, with a description of causes.


BAD DATA              String data was received from an open file, but the
                      program was expecting numeric data.
BAD SUBSCRIPT         The program was trying to reference an  element  of
                      an array whose  number  is  outside  of  the  range
                      specified in the DIM statement.
BREAK                 Program execution was stopped because you  hit  the
                      &lt;STOP&gt; key.
CAN'T CONTINUE        The CONT command will not work,  either because the
                      program was never RUN,  there has been an error, or
                      a line has been edited.
DEVICE NOT PRESENT    The required I/O device was not  available  for  an
                      OPEN, CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#, or GET#.
DIVISION BY ZERO      Division by zero is a mathematical oddity  and  not
                      allowed.
EXTRA IGNORED         Too many items of data were typed in response to an
                      INPUT statement. Only the first few items were
                      accepted.
FILE NOT FOUND        If you were looking for a file on tape, and END-OF-
                      TAPE marker was found. If you were looking on disk,
                      no file with that name exists.
FILE NOT OPEN         The file specified in a CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#,
                      or GET#, must first be OPENed.
FILE OPEN             An attempt was made to open a file using the number
                      of an already open file.
FORMULA TOO COMPLEX   The string expression  being  evaluated  should  be
                      split into at least two parts  for  the  system  to
                      work with, or a formula has too many parentheses.
ILLEGAL DIRECT        The  INPUT  statement  can  only  be  used within a
                      program, and not in direct mode.
ILLEGAL QUANTITY      A number used as the  argument  of  a  function  or
                      statement is out of the allowable range.
LOAD                  There is a problem with the program on tape.
NEXT WITHOUT FOR      This is caused by either incorrectly nesting  loops
                      or having a variable name in a NEXT statement  that
                      doesn't correspond with one in a FOR statement.
NOT INPUT FILE        An  attempt  was  made  to INPUT or GET data from a
                      file which was specified to be for output only.
NOT OUTPUT FILE       An attempt was mode to PRINT data to a  file  which
                      was specified as input only.
OUT OF DATA           A READ statement was executed but there is no  data
                      left unREAD in a DATA statement.
OUT OF MEMORY         There is no  more  RAM  available  for  program  or
                      variables.  This  may  also occur when too many FOR
                      loops have been nested,  or when there are too many
                      GOSUBs in effect.
OVERFLOW              The result of a  computation  is  larger  than  the
                      largest number allowed, which is 1.70141884E+38.
REDIM'D ARRAY         An array may only be DIMensioned once.  If an array
                      variable  is  used  before  that array is DIM'd, an
                      automatic DIM operation is performed on that  array
                      setting the number of  elements  to  ten,  and  any
                      subsequent DIMs will cause this error.
REDO FROM START       Character   data  was  typed  in  during  an  INPUT
                      statement when numeric data was expected.  Just re-
                      type  the  entry  so  that  it is correct,  and the
                      program will continue by itself.
RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB  A RETURN statement was encountered,  and  no  GOSUB
                      command has been issued.
STRING TOO LONG       A string can contain up to 255 characters.
SYNTAX ERROR          A statement is unrecognizable by the Commodore 64.
                      A   missing   or   extra   parenthesis,  misspelled
                      keywords, etc.
TYPE MISMATCH         This error occurs when a number is used in place of
                      a string, or vice-versa.
UNDEF'D FUNCTION      A user defined function was referenced,  but it has
                      never been defined using the DEF FN statement.
UNDEF'D STATEMENT     An attempt was made to GOTO or GOSUB or RUN  a line
                      number that doesn't exist.
VERIFY                The program on tape or  disk  does  not  match  the
                      program currently in memory.
VERIFY                The  program  on  tape  or  disk does not match the
                      program currently in memory.

APPENDIX Q

COMMODORE 64 SOUND CONTROL SETTINGS


  This  handy  table  gives  you  the key numbers you need to use in your
sound  programs,  according  to  which of the Commodore 64's 3 voices you
want to use. To set or adjust a sound control in your BASIC program, just
POKE  the  number  from  the second column, followed by a comma (,) and a
number  from  the  chart ... like this: POKE 54276,17 (Selects a Triangle
Waveform for VOICE 1).
  Remember  that  you  must set the VOLUME before you can generate sound.
POKE  54296  followed  by a number from 0 to 15 sets the volume for all 3
voices.
  It takes 2 separate POKEs to generate each musical note ... for example
POKE 54273,34: POKE 54272,75 designates low C in the sample scale bellow.
  Also  ...  you aren't limited to the numbers shown in the tables. If 34
doesn't sound &quot;right&quot; for a low C, try 35. To provide a higher SUSTAIN or
ATTACK  rate than those shown,  add two or more SUSTAIN numbers together.
(Examples:  POKE  54277,96  combines  two  attack rates (32 and 64) for a
combined  higher  attack  rate  ...  but ... POKE 54277,20 provides a low
attack rate (16) and a medium decay rate (4).

6581 SOUND INTERFACE DEVICE (SID)
CHIP SPECIFICATIONS


CONCEPT

  The  6581  Sound  Interface  Device  (SID)  is  a single-chip,  3-voice
electronic  music synthesizer/sound effects generator compatible with the
6510 and similar microprocessor families.  SID provides wide-range, high-
resolution control of pitch (frequency),  tone color  (harmonic content),
and  dynamics (volume).  Specialized control circuitry minimizes software
overhead,  facilitating  use  in  arcade/home  video  games  and low-cost
musical instruments.

      Attack Rate: 2 ms - 8 s
      Decay Rate: 6 ms - 24 s
      Sustain Level: 0 - peak volume
      Release Rate: 6 ms - 24 s
o OSCILLATOR SYNCHRONIZATION
o RING MODULATION

DESCRIPTION

  The  6581  consists  of  three  synthesizer  &quot;voices&quot; which can be used
independently  or  in  conjunction  with  each  other  (or external audio
sources)  to  create  complex  sounds.  Each  voice  consists  of  a Tone
Oscillator/Waveform Generator,  an  Envelope Generator  and  an Amplitude
Modulator.  The  Tone Oscillator  controls  the pitch of the voice over a
wide  range.  The  Oscillator  produces  four  waveforms  at the selected
frequency,  with  the  unique harmonic content of each waveform providing
simple  control of tone color.  The volume dynamics of the oscillator are
controlled by the Amplitude Modulator under the direction of the Envelope
Generator.  When  triggered,  the Envelope Generator creates an amplitude
envelope with programmable rates of increasing and decreasing volume.  In
addition  to  the  three  voices,  a  programmable Filter is provided for
generating complex, dynamic tone colors via subtractive synthesis.
  SID  allows the microprocessor to read the changing output of the third
Oscillator and third  Envelope Generator.  These outputs can be used as a
source  of modulation information for creating vibrato,  frequency/filter
sweeps and similar effects. The third oscillator can also act as a random
number   generator  for  games.  Two  A/D  converters  are  provided  for
interfacing SID with potentiometers. These can be used for &quot;paddles&quot; in a
game  environment or as front panel controls in a music synthesizer.  SID
can  process  external  audio signals,  allowing multiple SID chips to be
daisy-chained or mixed in complex polyphonic systems.

SID CONTROL REGISTERS

  There are 29 eight-bit registers in SID which control the generation of
sound.  These registers are either WRITE-only or READ-only and are listed
below in Table 1.

APPENDIX S

DISK and PRINTER COMMANDS and STATEMENTS


  The  following  BASIC commands and statements let you perform a variety
of operations on disk drives and any compatible Commodore printer.


CLOSE

TYPE: I/O Statement
FORMAT: CLOSE &lt;file number&gt;

  Action:  This statement shuts off any data file or channel to a device.
The  file  number  is the same as when the file or device was OPENed (see
OPEN statement and the section on INPUT/OUTPUT programming).
  When  working  with  storage  devices  like disks,  the CLOSE operation
stores any incomplete buffers to the device.  When this is not performed,
the  file  will  be unreadable on the disk.  The CLOSE operation isn't as
necessary with other devices, but it does free up memory for other files.
See your external device manual for more details.

EXAMPLES of CLOSE Statement:

  10 CLOSE 1
  20 CLOSE X
  30 CLOSE 9 * (1 + J)


CMD

TYPE: I/O Statement
FORMAT: CMD &lt;file number&gt;[,string]

  Action:  This  statement switches the primary output device from the TV
screen to the file specified.  This file could be on disk, printer, or an
I/O  device like the modem.  The file number must be specified in a prior
OPEN statement.  The string, when specified, is sent to the file. This is
handy for titling printouts, etc.
  When this command is in effect,  any PRINT statements and LIST commands
will not display on the screen, but will send the text in the same format
to the file.
  To  re-direct the output back to the screen,  the PRINT# command should
send  a  blank  line  to the CMD device before CLOSEing,  so it will stop
expecting data (called &quot;un-listening&quot; the device).
  Any system error  (like  ?SYNTAX ERROR)  will cause output to return to
the  screen.  Devices  aren't  un-listened by this,  so you should send a
blank line after an error condition. (See your printer or disk manual for
more details.)

EXAMPLES of CMD Statement:

  OPEN 4,4: CMD 4,&quot;TITLE&quot;: LIST: REM LISTS PROGRAM ON PRINTER
  PRINT#4: CLOSE 4: REM UN-LISTENS AND CLOSES PRINTER

  10 OPEN 1, 8 ,4, &quot;TEST&quot;: REM CREATE SEQ FILE
  20 CMD 8: REM OUTPUT TO SEQ FILE, NOT SCREEN
  30 FOR L = 1 TO 100
  40 PRINT L: REM PUTS NUMBER IN DISK BUFFER
  50 NEXT
  60 PRINT# 1: REM UNLISTEN
  70 CLOSE 1: REM WRITE UNFINISHED BUFFER, PROPERLY FINISH


GET#

TYPE: I/O Statement
FORMAT: GET# &lt;file number&gt;,&lt;variable list&gt;

  Action:  This  statement reads characters one-at-a-time from the device
or  file specified.  It works the same as the GET statement,  except that
the data comes from a different place than the keyboard.  If no character
is received, the variable is set to an empty string (equal to &quot;&quot;) or to 0
for  numeric variables.  Characters used to separate data in files,  like
the comma (,)  or  &lt;RETURN&gt; key code (ASC code of 13),  are received like
any other character.
  When  used  with  device  #3  (TV screen),  this  statement  will  read
characters one by one from the screen.  Each use of GET# moves the cursor
1 position to the right.  The character at the end of the logical line is
changed to a CHR$(13), the &lt;RETURN&gt; key code.

EXAMPLES of GET# Statement:

   5 GET# 1, A$
  10 OPEN 1, 3: GET# 1, Z7$
  20 GET# 1, A, B, C$, D$


INPUT#

TYPE: I/O Statement
FORMAT: INPUT# &lt;file number&gt;,&lt;variable list&gt;

  Action:  This  is  usually the fastest and easiest way to retrieve data
stored  in a file on disk.  The data is in the form of whole variables of
up to 80 characters in length,  as opposed to the one-at-a-time method of
GET#.  First,  the file must have been OPENed,  then  INPUT# can fill the
variables.
  The  INPUT#  command  assumes  a  variable  is finished when it reads a
&lt;RETURN&gt; code (CHR$(13)), a comma (,), semicolon (;), or colon(:).  Quote
marks  can  be  used to enclose these characters when writing if they are
needed (See PRINT# statement).
  If  the  variable type used is numeric,  and non-numeric characters are
received,  a  BAD DATA  error  results.  INPUT# can read strings up to 80
characters long, beyond which a STRING TOO LONG error results.
  When  used  with  device #3  (the screen),  this statement will read an
entire logical line and move the cursor down to the next line.

EXAMPLES of INPUT# Statement:

  10 INPUT# 1, A
  20 INPUT# 2, A$, B$


LOAD

TYPE: Command
FORMAT: LOAD &quot;&lt;file-name&gt;&quot;,&lt;device&gt;[,&lt;address&gt;]

  Action:  The  LOAD  statement reads the contents of a program file from
disk  into memory.  That way you can use the information LOADed or change
the  information in some way.  The disk unit is normally device number 8.
The  LOAD  closes  all open files and,  if it is used in direct mode,  it
performs  a  CLR (clear) before reading the program.  If LOAD is executed
from  within a program,  the program is RUN.  This means that you can use
LOAD  to  &quot;chain&quot;  several  programs together.  None of the variables are
cleared during a chain operation.
  If  you  are  using  file-name  pattern matching,  the first file which
matches  the  pattern  is loaded.  The asterisk in quotes by itself (&quot;*&quot;)
causes  the  first  file-name in the disk directory to be loaded.  If the
file-name  used does not exist or if it is not a program file,  the BASIC
error message ?FILE NOT FOUND occurs.
  If  you  use  the secondary address of 1 this will cause the program to
LOAD to the memory location from which it was saved.

EXAMPLES of LOAD Command:

  LOAD A$,8                   (Uses the name in A$ to search)

  LOAD &quot;*&quot;,8                  (LOADs first program from disk)

  LOAD &quot;$&quot;,8                  (LOADs disk directory)

  LOAD &quot;FUN&quot;,8                (LOAD a file from disk)
  SEARCHING FOR FUN
  LOADING
  READY.

  LOAD &quot;GAME ONE&quot;,8,1         (LOAD a file to the specific memory
  SEARCHING FOR GAME ONE      location from which the program was
  LOADING                     saved on the disk)
  READY.


OPEN

TYPE: I/O Statement
FORMAT: OPEN &lt;file-num&gt;,&lt;device&gt;[,&lt;address&gt;][,&quot;&lt;file-name&gt;[,&lt;type&gt;]
             [,&lt;mode&gt;]&quot;]

  Action:  This  statement  OPENs  a channel for input and/or output to a
peripheral  device.  However,  you may NOT need all those parts for every
OPEN statement. Some OPEN statements require only 2 codes:

1) LOGICAL FILE NUMBER
2) DEVICE NUMBER

  The  &lt;file-num&gt;  is  the  logical file number,  which relates the OPEN,
CLOSE,  CMD,  GET#,  INPUT#,  and  PRINT#  statements  to  each other and
associates them with the file-name and the piece of equipment being used.
The logical file number can range from 1 to 255 and you can assign it any
number you want in that range.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE:  File  numbers  over 128 were really designed for other uses so |
| it's good practice to use only numbers below 127 for file numbers.    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  Each peripheral device  (printer, disk drive) in the system has its own
number  which  it  answers  to.  The &lt;device&gt; number is used with OPEN to
specify  on  which  device  the  data file exists.  Peripherals like disk
drives  or printers also answer to several secondary addresses.  Think of
these  as  codes  which  tell each device what operation to perform.  The
device logical file number is used with every GET#, INPUT#, and PRINT#.
  The  file-name  can also be left out,  but later on in your program you
can NOT call the file by name if you have not already given it one.
  For  disk  files,  the  secondary addresses 1 thru 14 are available for
data-files, but other numbers have special meanings in DOS commands.  You
must  use  a  secondary address when using your disk drive(s).  (See your
disk drive manual for DOS command details.)
  The  &lt;file-name&gt;  is  a  string  of 1-16 characters and is optional for
printer  files.  If  the  file  &lt;type&gt;  is left out the type of file will
automatically  default  to the Program file unless the  &lt;mode&gt;  is given.
Sequential files are OPENed for reading  &lt;mode&gt;=R unless you specify that
files should be OPENed for writing  &lt;mode&gt;=W is specified.  A file &lt;type&gt;
can be used to OPEN an existing Relative file.  Use REL for  &lt;type&gt;  with
Relative files. Relative and Sequential files are for disk only.
  If you try to access a file before it is OPENed the BASIC error message
?FILE NOT OPEN  will  occur.  If you try to OPEN a file for reading which
does  not exist the BASIC error message ?FILE NOT FOUND will occur.  If a
file is OPENed to disk for writing and the file-name already exists,  the
DOS error message FILE EXISTS occurs. If a file is OPENed that is already
OPEN,  the BASIC error message FILE OPEN occurs.  (See Printer Manual for
further details.)

EXAMPLES of OPEN Statements:

  10 OPEN 2,8,4,&quot;DISK-OUTPUT,     (Opens sequential file on disk) --
     SEQ,W&quot;                       For Write

  10 OPEN 50,0                    (Keyboard input)

  10 OPEN 12,3                    (Screen output)

  10 OPEN 130,4                   (Printer output)

  10 OPEN 1,2,0,CHR$(10)          (Open channel to RS 232 device)

  10 OPEN 1,4,0,&quot;STRING&quot;          (Send upper case/graphics to the
                                  printer)

  10 OPEN 1,4,7,&quot;STRING&quot;          (Send upper/lower case to printer)

  10 OPEN 1,5,7,&quot;STRING&quot;          (Send upper/lower case to printer
                                  with device #5)

  10 OPEN 1,8,15,&quot;COMMAND&quot;        (Send a command to disk)

  10 OPEN 1,8,1,&quot;NAME,L&quot;+         (Relative file OPEN (1st time) where
     CHR$(X)                      X is the length of the relative record)

  10 OPEN 1,8,1,&quot;NAME&quot;            (Relative or sequential read)


PRINT#

TYPE: I/O Statement
FORMAT: PRINT# &lt;file-number&gt;[,&lt;variable&gt;][&lt;,/;&gt;&lt;variable&gt;]...

  Actions:  The PRINT# statement is used to write data items to a logical
file.  It must use the same number used to OPEN the file.  Output goes to
the device-number used in the OPEN statement.  The &lt;variable&gt; expressions
in the output-list can be of any type. The punctuation characters between
items  are  the  same as with the PRINT statement and they can be used in
the same way. The effects of punctuation are different in two significant
respects.
  If no punctuation finishes the list,  a carriage-return and a line-feed
are  written  at the end of the data.  If a comma or semicolon terminates
the  output-list,  the  carriage-return  and  line-feed  are  suppressed.
Regardless of the punctuation, the next PRINT# statement begins output in
the  next available character position.  The line-feed will act as a stop
when using the INPUT# statement;  leaving an empty variable when the next
INPUT# is executed. The line-feed can be suppressed of compensated for as
shown in the examples below.
  The easiest way to write more than one variable to a file on disk is to
set a string variable to CHR$(13), and use that string in between all the
other variables when writing the file.

EXAMPLES of PRINT# Statement:

1)
  10 OPEN 1,8,4, &quot;MY FILE&quot;
  20 R$=CHR$(18)                      (By Changing the CHR$(13) to
  30 PRINT#1,1;R$;2;R$;3;R$;4;R$;5    CHR$(44) you put a &quot;,&quot; between each
  40 PRINT#1,6                        variable. CHR$(59) would put a &quot;;&quot;
  50 PRINT#1,7                        between each variable.)

2)
  10 CO$=CHR$(44): CR$=CHR$(13)
  20 PRINT#1, &quot;AAA&quot;CO$&quot;BBB&quot;,          AAA,BBB  CCCDDDEEE
     &quot;CCC&quot;;&quot;DDD&quot;;&quot;EEE&quot;CR$             (carriage return)
     &quot;FFF&quot;CR$;                        FFF(carriage return)
  30 INPUT#1, A$,BCDE$,F$

3)
   5 CR$=CHR$(13)
  10 PRINT#2, &quot;AAA&quot;;CR$;&quot;BBB&quot;         (10 blanks) AAA
  20 PRINT#2, &quot;CCC&quot;;                  BBB
                                      (10 blanks) CCC
  30 INPUT#2, A$,B$,DUMMY$,C$


SAVE

TYPE: Command
FORMAT: SAVE &quot;&lt;file-name&gt;&quot;,&lt;device-number&gt;[,&lt;address&gt;]

  Action: The SAVE command is used to store the program that is currently
in memory onto a diskette file.  The program being SAVEd is only affected
by  the  command while the SAVE is happening.  The program remains in the
current  computer memory even after the SAVE operation is completed until
you put something else there by using another command. The file type will
be  &quot;prg&quot; (program).  The SAVE statement can be used in your programs and
execution  will  continue  with  the  next  statement  after  the SAVE is
completed.
  When saving programs onto a disk, the &lt;file-name&gt; must be present.

EXAMPLES of SAVE Command:

  SAVE &quot;FUN DISK&quot;,8   (SAVES on disk (device 8 is the disk))
  SAVE A$,8           (Store on disk with the name A$)


SAVE and REPLACE

TYPE: Command
FORMAT: SAVE &quot;@0:&lt;file-name&gt;&quot;,&lt;device-number&gt;

  Action:  This  version  of  the  SAVE  command  is used to overwrite an
existing  file  or  program  on  disk.  Saving  a program with the normal
version  of  the SAVE command will not store the program if the name used
already exists, although no disk error is indicated.

EXAMPLE of SAVE and REPLACE:

  SAVE &quot;@0:ME&quot;,8      (Overwrites &quot;ME&quot; on disk with update version)


VERIFY

TYPE: Command
FORMAT: VERIFY &quot;&lt;file-name&gt;&quot;,&lt;device&gt;

  Action:  The  VERIFY  command  is  used,  in direct or program mode, to
compare  the  contents  of  a BASIC program file on disk with the program
currently in memory.  VERIFY is normally used right after a SAVE, to make
sure that the program was stored correctly on tape or disk.
  For disk files (device number 8), the file-name must be present. If any
difference  in  program  text are found,  the BASIC error message ?VERIFY
ERROR is displayed.
  A  program  name  can  be  given  either  in quotes (&quot;&quot;) or as a string
variable.

EXAMPLE of VERIFY Command:

  9000 SAVE &quot;ME&quot;,8
  9010 VERIFY &quot;ME&quot;,8       (Looks at device 8 for the program)
