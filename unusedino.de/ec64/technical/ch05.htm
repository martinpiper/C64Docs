Editor's Notes:
by Craig Taylor

  It seems that each issue of C= Hacking has always began with a &quot;Sorry, It's
  late but here it is message.&quot; - Well, this one will start out again like 
  that - This issue was originally scheduled to be out the middle of January
  but due to several delays in obtaining articles and my delaying trying to
  debug the multi-tasking source code it's been held up until now. 
  
  My apologies to the authors who have had their articles into me on time -
  school is coming first for me and having to do a lot of coding for several
  classes was the major contributing factor to the delays. 

  Now, after the apologies are out of the way - Let's take a look at what has
  happened since last time I wrote.

  - RUN magazine is no longer with us.

  As one of the last hold-outs I was expecting RUN magazine to keep on printing
  until the Commodore 64/128's really did die out but apparently the publishers
  decided it wouldn't be so. This leaves the Twin Cities magazine as the only
  US magazine in publication for the Commodore (6502 based) computers that I am
  aware of. Speaking of Twin Cities (not sure if he's combining the 64/128 or
  just coming out with seperate Twin Cities magazines) does anybody know or
  have any information on when the next issue will be out? Or has my 
  lastest issue just not been sent out?

  As I was writing this I got the latest issue of Twin Cities which has
  expanded to C=64 coverage also. The new issue looks very nice, about 53
  pages of so of good decent material. I'd recommend get a subscription for
  those of you who are looking to still hear about new Commodore products.

  I'd like to get people's reactions on the demise of RUN and what will
  people will think will probably be the main source of information for C=
  owners.  A lot of people reading this magazine are on the comp.sys.cbm
  newsgroup but I'm wondering about individuals who do not have access to
  such a newsgroup and do not have access to the internet. Let me know what
  you think - hopefully through a friend w/ access to the internet. Sort of
  a catch-22 I guess.

  - A Mail-Server has been setup to automate sending issue requests.

  The full details of how to use the Mail-Server is in a documentation file
  contained within but this mail-server (whose source code is available for
  anyone who wishes to see it written in VAX DCL code) also allows file
  requests which will be uuencoded and sent to you. I am trying to have all of
  the programs in each issue available via request as for some people it is
  a minor pain trying to extract and compile the programs contained within.

  - I saw a note recently that the speed-up board work was still being done.

  Does anybody know anything further about this? I'm interested in this and
  how it would be carried out / done but aside from an occasional post here
  and there about it I actually hear very little. 

  - There is also work on an Ansi C compiler being done.

  Recently a group of people (about 9 currently) are working on a C compiler
  for the C=64 and C=128 which will eventually support the full ANSI C
  library. A large list of extensions have been proposed and the compiler
  will probably be released as either shareware or possibly, public domain.

  Ack! - This magazine keeps growing. The last issue was approx.
  somewhere around 3000 lines, this one is just a tad over 6000. I'm
  sure that we're not suffering the quality just because of the
  quantity. :-) Be sure to take a look at the previous back issues
  available via the Mail-Server and don't be afraid to suggest comments
  or suggestions. While usually the authors are too busy to take ideas
  for new programs we always welcome to hear how useful you find certain
  programs included herein etc.

  Also I am looking for articles on any type of software project, hardware
  project or general theory articles that you would like to submit. Just
  leave me a message via email at &quot;duck@pembvax1.pembroke.edu&quot;. Note also
  that I've just signed up for a GENIE account and can be reached there via
  C.TAYLOR37 once my account is approved.

Mail-Server Documentation

This articles describes how to access the mail-server for Commodore Hacking
and includes a list of currently available files and back-issues.

Stretching Sprites

It's possible to expand sprites to more than twice their original size, but 
there is no need to expand all of them equally. This article examins how to
expand them 2,3, or more multiples of their original size.

Rob Hubbard's Music: Disassembled, Commented and Explained

This article written by Anthony McSweeney, presents the valuable source to
Rob Hubbard's first music routine. This routine was used in Rob's first 20
or 30 musics, including such classics as Thing on a Spring (Gremlin Graphics),
Commando (Elite), Thrust (Firebird), International Karate (System 3), and
Proteus (also known as Warhawk, by Firebird). 

ZPM3 and ZCCP Enhancements for CP/M Plus from Simeon Cran

Although all the articles to date in C= Hacking have focused on 6510/ 8502
programming, there have been some interesting developments on the Z80 front.
C128 CP/M users should be aware of the benefits of a new set of enhancements
to the operating system that offers inreased speed and flexibility as well
as new features. If that isn't enough, this package will also run ZCPR 3.3
utilities and applications that won't run under standard CP/M Plus.

Multi-Tasking on the C=128 - Part 1

This article examines the rudiments of Multi-Tasking and also details the
system calls in the Multi-Tasking package to be released in the next issue
of C= Hacking.

LITTLE RED WRITER: MS-DOS file reader/writer for the C128 and 1571/81.

This article is an extension on Little Red Reader which was presented in the
last issue and allows for reading and writing of MS-Dos diskettes from and to
1571/81 drives.

Mail-Server Documentation
by Craig Taylor (duck@pembvax1.pembroke.edu)

What is a mail-server?

   A mailserver is an automated job that will scan my mail file for messages
   with a subject line of &quot;MAILSERV&quot; and will then automatically carry out
   certain operations within the body of the mail message. This makes it easier
   on me and you. Easier for me so that I don't have to deal with 50+ messages
   each month asking for files to be sent out and also insures that your files
   that you requested will be sent within 24 hours. In addition it allows 
   files to be more easily sent and accessed in case you are not able to 
   extract the source files from C= Hacking. 

   If you have FTP access please see the Editor's Notes at the start for
   information on R. Knop's FTP site and how to access it as you may find
   using that somewhat quicker to use.

How to use the mail-server / What it is.

   This mail-server is intended to help me keep track / more easily update my
   mailing list of individuals who wish to sub-scribe or get back-issues of
   C= Hacking mailed to them. 

   To use it simply send a message to &quot;duck@pembvax1.pembroke.edu&quot; (me) with a
   subject line of &quot;MAILSERV&quot; and then with one of the following commands in the
   body of the mail message:

Currently the following commands are supported:

  help              - sends current documentation f file list
  send iss&lt;number&gt;. - sends issue # (1-4 currently). Remember the period!!
  subscribe         - subscribe to the mailing list automatically
 *subscribe catalog - subscribes to a list that will be sent out 
                      everytime the catalog changes.
  catalog           - show list of available source /uuencoded binaries
  psend name        - send uuencoded binary.

Commands no longer supported:

  status            - returns the current commands (this list)
                      (use the help file)

Please note that the mailserver is only run at 2:00 AM EST.

The Demo Corner: Stretching Sprites
by Pasi 'Albert' Ojala (po87553@cs.tut.fi)
        Written: 16-May-91  Translation/Revision 01-Jun-92, Dec-92

(All timings are in PAL, principles will apply to NTSC too)

You might have heard that it is possible to expand sprites to more than
twice their original size. Imagine a sprite scroller with 6-times expanded
sprites. However, there is no need to expand all of them equally. Using
this technique, it is possible to make easy sinus effects and constantly
expanding and shrinking letters.

The VIC (video interface controller) may be fooled in many things. One of
them is the vertical expansion of sprites. If you clear the expand flag and
then set it back straight away, VIC will think it has only displayed the
first one of the expanded lines. If we do the trick again, VIC will continue
to display the same data again and again. But why does VIC behave like this ?


_Logic gates will tell the truth_

It is not really a bug, but a feature. The hardware design to implement the
vertical enlargement was just as simple as possible. Those, who do not care
about hardware should skip this part... The whole y-enlargement is handled
with five simple logical ports. Each sprite has an associated Set-Reset
flip-flop to tell whether to jump to the next sprite line (add three bytes
to the data counter) or not.

Let's call the state of the flip-flop Q and the inputs R (reset) and S (set).
The function of a SR flip-flop is quite simple: if R is one, Q goes to zero,
if S is one, Q goes to one. Otherwise the state of the flip-flop does not
change. In this case the flip-flop is Set, if either the Y-enlargement bit
is zero or the state of the flip-flop is zero at the end of a scan line. The
flip-flop is reset, if both the state and the Y-enlargement are ones at the
end of the line.

When you clear the bit in the vertical expansion register, the flip-flop will
be set regardless of the electron beam position on the scan line. If you
set the bit again before the end of the line, the flip-flop will be cleared
and VIC will be displaying the same sprite line again. In other words, VIC
will think that it is starting to display the second line of the expanded
sprite row. This way any of the lines in any of the sprites may be stretched
as wanted.

 .---- Current flipflop state (if one, enables add to sprite pointer)
 |  .---- Y-expansion bit.
 |  |  .--- End of line pulse (briefly one at end of line)
 |  |  |  .--- Next state (What state will become under these conditions)
 |  |  |  |
 0  0  0  1
 0  0  1  1
 0  1  0  no change
 0  1  1  1
 1  0  0  1             Clear $D017 -&gt; flip-flop is set
 1  0  1  1
 1  1  0  no change     Set $D017   -&gt; flip-flop resets at the end of line
 1  1  1  0

So, simply, at any time, if vertical expand is zero, the add enable is set
to one. At the end of the line - before adding - the state is cleared if
vertical expand is one.


_Even odder ?_

Something very weird happens when we clear the expansion bit right when VIC
is adding three to the sprite image counters. The values in the counters will
be increased only by two, and the data is then read from the wrong place.

Normally the display of a sprite ends when VIC has shown all of the 21
lines of the sprite (the counter will end up to $3f). If there has been a
counter mixup, $3f is not reached after 21 lines and VIC will go on counting
and will display the sprite again, now normally. If we fool the counter only
once, the counter value $3f is reached when the sprite is displayed twice.


_Fiddling_

I don't think the distorted counter effect can be used for anything, but
there is many things where the variable stretching could be used. When you
open the borders, you can be sure that there is a constant amount of time,
if you stretch the sprites to the whole lenght of the area. You may stretch
only the first and last lines, stretch the other lines by a constant or
using a table, or using a variable table or any of the combinations possible.


_A raster routine is a must_

Because you have to access the VIC registers on each line during the stretch,
you need some kind of routine which can do other kinds of tricks besides the
stretch. You can open the side borders and change the background color and
maybe you have to shift the screen (and the bad lines with it) downwards.
[See previous C=Hacking Issues for talk about raster interrupts.]

Look at the demo program. In the beginning of the raster routine there is
first some timing, then a loop that lasts exactly 46 clock cycles. It takes
exactly one scan line to execute. Inside the loop we first do the necassary
modifications to the vertical scroll register, then we change the background
color and then we open the side borders. And finally we handle the stretching
using the stretch data, where a zero-bit means that the corresponding sprite
will be stretched. A one-bit means that VIC is allowed to go to the next line
of the sprite data.


_Stretching takes time_

Besides showing the stretched sprites we need time to generate the stretching
data, unless of course, the stretch is constant. We have to have 20
one-bits for each sprite in our table. It is not feasible to determine the
state of each byte in the table, instead you clear the table and plot the
needed bits.

The routine is quite straightforward, but many optimizations may be applied
to make it faster. First we load Y with the stretch of the first line (the
y-coordinate of the data). Then we use it as an index to the table and plot
the right bit and increase Y with the expansion value. Then we do it again
until we have all of the 20 bits scattered to the table. The last sprite line
will then stretch until we stop the stretching, because the last line is
not allowed to be drawn.


_Speed is everything_

The calculation itself is easy, but optimizing the routine is not. If all
of the sprites are stretched equally (by integer amounts) and from the same
position, the routine is the fastest possible.  You can also have variable
and smooth stretch.  Smooth stretch uses other than integer expansion values
and thus also needs more processor time.  If each sprite has to be stretched
individually, you need much more time to do it.

The fastest routine I have ever written uses some serious selfmodification
tricks. There are also some other tricks to speed up the stretch, but they
are all secret ones.. :-)  Well, what the h*ck, I will include it anyway.
By the time you read this I have already made a faster routine..

You can speed up that routine (by 17%) by unrolling the inner loop, but you
have to use a different addressing mode for ORA (zero-page). You also need
to place some restrictions to the tables used.. If you unroll both loops,
you can get ~25% faster routine than the Fore!-version.


_Demo program_

I tried to collect all of the main principles of stretching and raster
routines to the demo program. I use the term &quot;raster routine&quot; when the
execution is tightly synchronized to the electron beam and to the screen
display. The program may be unclear in places, but I wanted to keep it as
short as possible. The routine opens the side borders, scrolls the screen
vertically, changes the background color and stretches the sprites.

The stretcher routine allows different y-position and amount of expansion
for each sprite. This routine uses 1/8 fractions to do the counting, and so
it is much too slow to use in a real demo.  VIC registers are initialized
from a table, instead of setting them separately. Interrupt position is one
line above the sprites. The program does not open the top or bottom borders.
(I usually use a NMI to open the vertical borders, so that I only need to
 use one raster-IRQ position.)

I tried to make a NTSC version, but I couldn't get it to synchronize.
There are also less cycles available so you can't stretch all of the sprites
individually in NTSC (with this routine that is..).

Timings:

clear 128 bytes: 514  + 12 cycles       8.16 lines
7 passes       : 3820 + 12 cycles       60.6 lines = 8.66 lines/pass

The unrolled clear routine consists of one load (lda #$00) and 128
store instructions (sta $nnnn). 12 cycles are counted for JSR/RTS.

Stretching of 8 sprites would take slightly less than 80 lines, which is one
fourth of the total raster time. Displaying a 128-line high stretcher takes
about 130 lines (counting sprite setup and synchronization), scroller couple
of lines more. Total 212 lines leaves 100 lines (6300 cycles) free for other
activities in a PAL system. In a NTSC system you would have only 50 lines
left.


A simple basic routine to create the stretch data:
-------------------------------------------------
a=0:for f=0 to 127:a=a+Height*(2+sin(f*PI/64)):poke Table+f,a:
poke Table+f+128,a:a=a-int(a):next f

This will also handle the 'rounding'. Because of this we don't have to
handle fractions in the stretcher routine. The use of a table also gives the
opportunity to have a separate size for each sprite line. The table does
not need to be a sinus, it could have triangle or any other 'waveform' as
long as the minimum value in the table (sprite line size) is 1.


A basic routine to do the size/2 table:
--------------------------------------
a=0:for f=0 to 19:a=a+peek(Table+f):next f: rem get the size in position 0
for f=0 to 127:poke STable+f,a/2:a=a-peek(Table+f)+peek(Table+f+20):next f

Rob Hubbard's Music: Disassembled, Commented and Explained
by Anthony McSweeney (u882859@postoffice.utas.edu.au)

[Ed's Note: I questioned this article concerning copyright problems and he
has assured me that it is legal to present it in entirity like this as it is
past a certain # of years. Accordingly I'm presenting it and any concerns
should be taken up with him and not myself.]

Introduction:
************

  How do you introduce someone like Rob Hubbard?? He came, he saw and he
conquered the '64 world. In my estimation, this one man was resposible for
selling more '64 software than any other single person. Hell! I think that Rob
Hubbard was responsible for selling more COMMODORE 64's than any other person!
I certainly bought my '64 after being blown away by the Monty on the Run music
in December 1985. In the next few years, Rob would totally dominate the '64
music scene, releasing one hit after another. I will even say that some really
terrible games sold well only on the strength of their brilliant Rob Hubbard
music (eg. KnuckleBusters and W.A.R.).

  So how did Rob achieve this success? Firstly (of course) he is a superb
composer and musician, able to make the tunes that bring joy to our hearts
everytime we hear them! (also consider the amazing diversity of styles of
music that Rob composed). Secondly, he was able to make music which was suited
to the strengths and limitations of the SID chip. Just recall the soundfx used
at the beginning of Thrust, or in the Delta in-game music. Perhaps the biggest
limitation of SID must be the meagre 3 channels that can be used, but most
Hubbard songs appear to have four, five or even more instruments going (just
listen to the beginning of Phantoms of the Asteriods for example... that's
only one channel used!!). I could really go on for (p)ages identifying the
outstanding things that Rob Hubbard did, so I will finally mention that Rob's
coding skills and his music routines were a major factor in his success.


The First Rob Hubbard Routine:
*****************************

  Rob Hubbard created a superb music routine from the very first tune which
was released (Confuzion). Furthermore, Rob used this routine to make music
for a very long time, only changing it _slightly_ over time. The sourcecode
that I present here was used (with slight modifications) in: Confuzion, Thing
on a Spring, Monty on the Run, Action Biker, Crazy Comets, Commando, Hunter
Patrol, Chrimera, The Last V8, Battle of Britain, Human Race, Zoids, Rasputin,
Master of Magic, One Man &amp; His Droid, Game Killer, Gerry the Germ, Geoff Capes
Strongman Challenge, Phantoms of the Asteroids, Kentilla, Thrust,
International Karate, Spellbound, Bump Set and Spike, Formula 1 Simulator,
Video Poker, Warhawk or Proteus and many, many more! All you would need to do
to play a different music is to change the music data at the bottom, and a few
lines of the code.

  This particular routine has been ripped off by many famous groups and
people over the years, but I don't think that they were ever generous enough
to share it around. Can you remember The Judges and Red Software?? They made
the famous Red-Hubbard demo, and used it in Rhaa-Lovely and many of their
other productions. I'm sure that the (Atari) ST freaks reading this will love
Mad Max (aka Jochen Hippel), and remember the BIG demo which featured approx
100 Rob Hubbard tunes converted to the ST. Although I hate to admit it, I
decided to start sharing around my own sourcecode after receiving the amazing
Protracker sourcecode (340K!) on the Amiga (thanks Lars Hamre). That made me
shameful to be selfish, especially after I learned alot of from it. Why don't
YOU share around your old sourcecodes too!

  The particular routine that is included below was ripped from Monty on the
Run, and it appeared in memory from $8000 to about $9554. The complete
routine had code for soundfx in it, which I have taken out for the sake of
clarity. Although the routine is really tiny - a mere 900 or 1000 bytes of
code, there are some amazingly complex concepts in it which require alot of
explanation if you don't know much about computer music or SID. Fortunately
for you, I have put in excellent label names for you, and also alot of really
helpful and amazing comments. In fact, I think this sourcecode must have a
much better structure and comments than Rob Hubbard's original!!! I think that
the best way to understand the sourcecode is to study it, and figure out what
is going on using the comments.

  In addition to the comments in the source, there are *3* descriptions of
the routine in this article. The first tells you how to use the music routine
when it's viewed as an already assembled 'module'. The second goes through an
overview of the music and instrument data format, and is great for getting an
overall feel for what the code is doing. The third description looks at the
various sections of the code, and how they come together.


How to use the sourcecode:
*************************

    jsr    music+0 to initialize the music number in the accumulator
    jsr    music+3 to play the music
    jsr    music+6 to stop the music and quieten SID

  The music is supposed to run at 50Hz, or 50 times per second. Therefore
PAL users can run the music routine off the IRQ like this:

    lda    #$00     ; init music number 0
    jsr    music+0
    sei             ; install the irq and a raster compare
    lda    #&lt;irq
    ldx    #&gt;irq
    sta    $314
    stx    $315
    lda    #$1b
    sta    $d011
    lda    #$01
    sta    $d01a
    lda    #$7f
    sta    $dc0d
    cli
loop =*
    jmp    loop     ; endless loop (music is now playing off interrupt :-)

irq =*
    lda    #$01
    sta    $d019
    lda    #$3c
    sta    $d012

    inc    $d020    ; play music, and show a raster for the time it takes
    jsr    music+3
    dec    $d020

    lda    #$14
    sta    $d018
    jmp    $ea31

  If this method is used on NTSC machines, then the music will be running at
60Hz and will sound much to fast - possibly it might sound terrible. I'm
afraid you'll have to put up with this unless YOU are good enough to make a
CIA interrupt at 50Hz. As I havn't had to worry about NTSC users before,
perhaps someone will send me the best way to do this...

[Ed. Note: You could also keep a counter for the IRQ and don't execute it
every 6 interrupt. This will make it the right speed although the best
solution is for modifying the CIA to 50Hz like he mentions above.]

How the music data is arranged:
******************************

1. The music 'module' contains one or more songs.

  Each RH music is made up of a 'bunch' of songs in a single module. Thus
the 'module' can have the title music, in-game music, and the game-over music
all using the same playroutine (and even the same instruments :). The source
that appears below only has the one song in it, and the music number is
automatically set to 0 as a result (line 20). The label 'songs' is where you
want to look for the pointers to the songs if you want to change this.

2. Each song is made up of three tracks.

  We all know that there are only 3 channels on the SID chip, so there are
also 3 tracks - one for each channel. When I said 'pointers to the songs'
above, I was therefore referring to 'pointers to the three tracks that make up
the song'...hence we are looking at the label 'songs' again. Each track needs
a high and low pointer, so there are 6 bytes needed to point to a song.

3. Each track is made up of a list of pattern numbers

  Each track consists of a list of the pattern numbers in the order in which
they are to be played. Here we are looking at the labels 'montymaintr1' and
'montymaintr2'and 'montymaintr3'. Therefore I can tell you that the initial
patterns played in this song are $11, $12 and $13 on channels 1,2 and 3
respectively. The track is either ended with a $ff or $fe byte. A $ff means
that the song needs to be looped when the end of the track is reached (like
the monty main tune), while a $fe means that the song is only to be played
once. The current offset into the track is often called the current POSITION
for that track.

4. A pattern consists of a sequence of notes.

  A pattern contains the data that says when the notes should be played, how
long they should be played for, at what pitch, with what instrument, should
there be ADSR, should there be bending (portamento) of the notes etc. Each
pattern is ended with a $ff byte, and when this is encountered, the next
pattern in the track will be played. Each note has up to a 4 byte
specification.

- The first byte is always the length of the note from 0-31 or 0-$1f in hex.
  You will notice that the top three bits are not used for the length of the
  note, so they are used for other things.
- Bit#5 signals no release needed. - Bit#6 signals that this note is
  appended to the last one (no attack/etc). - Bit#7 signals that a new
  instrument or portamento is coming up.

- The second byte is an optional byte, and it holds the instument number to
  use or the portamento value (ie a bended note). This byte will be needed
  according to whether bit#7 of the first byte is set or not...ie if the 1st
  byte was negative, then this byte is needed.
  - If the second byte is positive, then this is the new instrument number.
  - If the second byte is negative, then this is a bended note (portamento).
    and the value is the speed of the portamento (except for bits #7 and #0)
    Bit #0 of the portamento byte determines the direction of the bend.
    - Bit#0 = 0 then portamento is up.
    - Bit#0 = 1 then portamento is down.

- The third byte of the specification is the pitch of the note. A pitch of
  0 is the lowest C possible. A pitch of 12 or $C(hex) is the next highest
  C above that. These pitches are denoted fairly universally as eg. 'C-1' and
  for sharps eg. 'D#3'. Notice that this routine uses pitches of higher than
  72 ($48) which is c-6 :-)

- The fourth byte if it exists will denote the end of the pattern.
  ie. If the next byte is a $ff, then this is the end of the pattern.

NOTE: I have labelled the various bytes with numbers for convenience. Bear
in mind that some of these are optional, so if the second byte is not needed,
then I will say that the pitch of the note coming up is the 'third byte',
even though it isn't really.

Okay, here are some examples:

eg. $84,$04,$24 means that the length of the note is 4 (from the lower 5 bits
    of the first byte), that the instrument to use is instrument number 4
    (the second byte, as indicated by bit #7 of the first byte), and that the
    pitch of the note is $24 or c-3.
eg. $D6,$98,$25,$FF means that the length of the note is 22 ($16), that this
    note should be appended to the last, that the second byte is a portamento
    (as both 1st and 2nd bytes -ve!), that the portamento is going up (as
    bit#0 = 0) with a speed of 24 ($18), that the pitch of the note is $25
    or c#3, and that this is the end of the pattern.

It doesn't get any harder than that!! Did you realise that this is exactly
the way that Rob Hubbard made the music!! He worked out some musical ideas
on his cheap (musical) keyboard, and typed the notes into his assembler in
hex, just like this.


5. The instruments are an 8 byte data structure.

  You are looking at the label 'instr' at the bottom of the sourcecode. The
8 bytes which come along first are instrument numnber 0, the next 8 define
instrument number 1, etc. Here are the meanings of the bytes, but I suggest
that you check out your programming manuals if you are unfamiliar with these:

- Byte 0 is the pulse width low byte, and
- Byte 1 is the pulse width high byte. (also see byte 7).

- Byte 2 is the control register byte.
  This specifies which type of sound should be used; sine, sawtooth etc.

- Byte 3 is the attack and decay values, and
- Byte 4 is the sustain and release values.
  The note's volume is altered according to these values. When the attack and
  decay are over, the volume of the note is held at the sustain level. When
  length of a note is over, a release is done through the 'gate' bit in SID.

- Byte 5 is the vibrato depth for the instrument.

- Byte 6 is the pulse speed.
  Timbre is created by changing the shape of the waveform each 50th of a
  second, and this is the most common way of achieving it. The shape of
  the pulse waveform changes from square to a very rectangular at a speed
  according to this byte.
  N.B. if you are interested in how the pulse value number works, then
  e-mail me sometime, as I found this out (exhaustively) a few days ago!

- Byte 7 is the instrument fx byte, and is the major thing which changes
  between different music routines. Each bit in this byte determines whether
  this instrument will have a certain effect in it.
  - Bit#0 signals that this is a drum. Drums are made from a noise channel
    and also a fast frequency down, with fast decay. Bass drums use a square
    wave, and only the first 50th of a second is a noise channel. This is
    the tell-tale instrument that gives away a Rob Hubbard routine! Hihats
    and other drums use noise all the time.
  - Bit#1 signals a 'skydive'. This is a slower frequency down, that I think
    sounds like somebody yelling as they fall out of a plane .. AHHHHhhhhgh..
    ..hence I call it a skydive!!
  - Bit#2 signals an octave arpeggio. It's a very limited arpeggio routine in
    this song. Listen for the arpeggio and the skydive when combined, which
    is used alot in Hubbard songs.
  - All the other bits have no meaning in this music, but were used alot in
    later music for the fx.

A big reason that I presented this early routine, was because there was not
too much in the way of special fx to confuse you. As a result, you can
concentrate on the guts of the code instead of the special fx :-)


How the sourcecode works:
************************

  The routines at the top of the sourcecode are concerned with turning the
music on and off, and you will see that this is done through a variable called
'mstatus' (or music status). If mstatus is set to $C0, then the music is
turned off and SID is quietened, thereafter mstatus is set to $80 which means
that the music is still off, but SID doesn't need to be quietened again. When
the music is initialized, then mstatus is given a value of $40 which kicks in
the further initialization stuff. If mstatus is any other value, then the
music is being played. For any of the initialization stuff to have any meaning
to you, you ofcourse have to understand the rest of the playroutine :-)

  After we have got past the on/off/init stuff, we are at the label called
'contplay' at around line 100. The first thing you should notice is that this
is the start of a huge loop that is done *3* times - once for each channel.
The loop really *is* huge, as it ends right on the last few lines of the code
:-)

  Now that we are talking about routines within the loop, we are talking about
these routines being applied to the channels independantly. There are 2 main
routines within the loop, one is called NoteWork, and the other is called
SoundWork. NoteWork checks to see whether a new note is needed on this
channel, and if it is, then the notedata is fetched and stuff is initialized.
If no note is needed, then SoundWork is called which processes the instruments
and does the portamento.

  NoteWork first checks the speed at which the notes are fetched. If the delay
is still occurring, then new notes are not needed and soundwork is called.
N.B. that the speed for Monty on the Run is 1, which means that a note of
length $1f will last for 64 calls to the routine (ie just over a second). If
the speed of the song is reset, then NoteWork decrements the length of the
current note. When the length of the current note hits $ff (-1) then a new
note is needed, otherwise SoundWork is jumped to.

  The data for a new note is collected at the label 'getnewnote'. In the
simplest case, this involves getting the next bytes of data from the current
pattern on this channel, but if the end of the pattern is reached, then the
next pattern number is fetched by reference to the current position within
this channel's track. In an even more complex situation, the end of a track is
reached, and the current position needs to be reset to 0 before the next
pattern number can be found.

  You can see quite clearly in this part of the routine where the length of
the note is collected, and it is determined whether a 2nd byte is needed,
where the pitch is collected, and the end of the song checked. You can also
see where some of the data is collected from the current instrument and jammed
into the SID registers.

  SoundWork is called if no new notes are needed, and it processes the
instruments and does the portamento etc. This part of the routine is neatly
expressed in sections which are really well commented and quite easy to
understand.

- The first thing that occurs in SoundWork is that the 'gate bit' of SID is
  set when the length of the note is over - this causes a release of the note.

- The vibrato routine is quite inefficient, but it's pretty good for 1985!
  Ofcourse vibrato is implemented by raising and lowering the pitch of the
  note ever-so-slightly causing the note to 'float'. The amount of the
  vibrato is determined in the current instrument.

- The pulsework routine changes the pulsewidth between square wave and very
  rectangular wave according to the pulsespeed in the current instrument.
  (ie. it changes the sound of the instrument and thus alters the 'timbre')
  The routine goes backwards and forwards between the two; and switches
  when one extremity is reached. It's interesting to note that the current
  values of the pulse width are actually stored in the instrument :-)

- Portamento is achieved by adding/subtracting an amount of frequency to
  the current frequency each time this part of the routine is called.

- The instrument fx routines are also really easy to figure out, as they are
  well commented. Both the drums and the skydive do a very fast frequency
  down, so it is the most significant byte of the frequency which is reduced
  .. and not 16-bit maths (math?!) The arpeggio is only an octave arpeggio,
  so for the first 50th of a second, the current note is played, and for
  the next 50th of a second, current note+12 is played, followed by the
  current note again etc.
  ( If you don't know what an arpeggio is..it's generally when the notes of )
  ( a chord are played individually in a rapid succession. It produces a    )
  ( 'full' sound depending on the speed of the arpeggio. In most cases the  )
  ( note is changed 50 times per second, which gives a very nice sound. If  )
  ( you have listened to some computer music, then you will have definately )
  ( listened to an arpeggios all the time, even if you don't realize it!    )


Final Thoughts:
**************

  *Bounce* I'm finally near the end of this article! It has been alot of work
to try to explain this routine, but I'm glad that I've done it *grin* If you
have any questions then please feel free to e-mail me, or even e-mail Craig if
it's after August 1993 and I'll make sure that I leave a forwarding address
with him. Also, please feel free to e-mail me and tell me what you think of
this article. I will only be bothered writing more of the same if I know that
someone is finding them useful/interesting. Also e-mail me if you are
interested in Amiga or ST music too, as I've done alot on both of those
machines.

  I'm not sure whether Craig will be putting the actual sourcecode below this
text, or in some kind of Appendix. In either case, I SHALL take all legal
responsibilty for publishing Rob Hubbard's routine. Craig was quite reluctant
to publish the routine in his net-mag because of copyright reasons. As a
post-graduate law student that will be working as a commercial lawyer
(attourney for Americans :) specializing in copyright/patents for computer
software/hardware starting August this year, I don't believe that there are
any practical legal consequences for me.

  I would have given an arm or a leg for a commented Rob Hubbard sourcecode in
the past, so I hope you enjoy this valuable offering.

ZPM3 and ZCCP Enhancements for CP/M Plus from Simeon Cran
by Randy Winchester (randy@mit.edu)

Operating System Components

The CP/M Plus operating system consists of three modules.  The CCP (Console
Command Processor), is the part of CP/M that you see when you first boot the
system.  The CCP prints the A&gt; disk prompt, accepts user input, and loads
commands from disk.

The BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System) handles the CP/M functions of disk,
console, and printer input/output, and the tasks of file management.

The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) does the real input/output work for the
BDOS. The BIOS contains the code customized for the CP/M hardware that you're
using. On the C128, the BIOS contains the routines for driving the 40 and 80
column screens, using the REU as a RAM drive, and reading/writing several
different disk formats on 1571 and 1581 drives.  The BIOS can be thought of as
a collection of device drivers that are specific to your computer.


What's New - BIOS-R6

BIOS-R6 (C128 BIOS modified by Randy Winchester and others) is the latest of
the modified versions of the C128 CP/M BIOS.  Most of the changes to the BIOS
result in faster processing speed. For example, all the code for driving a 40
column screen has been removed.  Almost everyone using CP/M is going to be
using it in 80 columns anyway.  Cutting this code takes a big load off the
system and increases overall speed by about 15%.  Similarly, the interrupt
driven RS232 has been set from 300 to 75 baud.  The higher the baud rate, the
more processor time is required to service RS232.  Since the RS232 code is
always running, decreasing the baud rate frees up cycles that the processor
needs to service RS232.  This doesn't affect the operation of terminal programs
which explicitly set the baud rate when they start up.

Other features of BIOS-R6 include a screen dump function, commented source to
assist the programmer in producing customized systems, and support for
additional disk formats.  Some of the new disk formats include Commodore's
standard 1581 CP/M format, MAXI 71 (398K on 5.25&quot; disks), and GP 1581 (796K on
3.5&quot; disks).

C128 CP/M programmers who want to add or change operating system features
should try to make changes to the BIOS.  For one thing, BIOS source code is
available, but not available for the BDOS or CCP.  (Source code is not
available for the BDOS and CCP replacements mentioned in this article either). 
Another reason is that the BDOS and CCP are intended to be &quot;invariable&quot;
operating system components - that is, they are identical for different
computers that run CP/M Plus.  A study of the BIOS source code will reveal
segments of code that can be removed if they aren't needed, and will provide
hints as to new features that can be added.

The distribution package, BIOS-R6.LBR includes documentation, source code,
utilities, and support files.  BIOS-R6.LBR also contains the latest version of
ZPM3. [Ed. Note: The files mentioned in this article can be found via
anonymous FTP or via the mailserver through the &quot;psend&quot; command.]


ZPM3 Features

ZPM3 is a replacement BDOS by Simeon Cran.  Since the BDOS is supposed to be
&quot;invariable,&quot; why would anyone want to replace it? The answers to that are
pretty typical - bug fixes, speed enhancements, and new features!  ZPM3
interacts with the BIOS and CCP in most of the same ways as the standard
Digital Research BDOS, and for the most part appears to be a clone of the
standard BDOS.  The standard BDOS was coded in 8080 assembly to make it
compatible with machines that use the older slower 8080 processor.  Very few
(if any) CP/M Plus machines used the 8080. ZPM3 is coded in faster, compact Z80
assembly language, for the Z80 processor that is at the heart of most CP/M Plus
computers (including the C128).

The ZPM3 documentation details fixes to several bugs that have plagued CP/M
Plus since day one.  Although the bugs sound somewhat obscure, there's no
telling when one might cause problems.

ZPM3 is much faster than standard CP/M Plus.  The increased speed should be
obvious after using it for a short time.

The new features offered by ZPM3 are remarkable.  Three closely related
features are enhanced command line editing, a history buffer that stores and
recalls multiple commands, and Automatic Command Prompting.  These features
work in concert to provide a flexible and convenient command line interface. 
Command line editing now has 20 control key functions for moving or deleting by
characters or whole words.  The most recent command lines (up to 250
characters) are stored in the history buffer, and can be recalled and reused,
or reedited if necessary.  Automatic Command Prompting is best appreciated if
seen in action.  It's similar to command line completion in Unix, except that
it's automatic, with matching responses coming directly from the history
buffer.  If you've recently entered a long command line with lots of options,
and need to reuse it (or edit it slightly first), typing the first few unique
characters will bring back the entire command from the history buffer if it's
still intact.  Automatic Command Prompting is so radical that it might take
some getting used to. If you don't think you can get used to it, it can be shut
off.

The latest version of ZPM3, ZPM3N08.ARK, is included inside BIOS-R6.LBR, and
can also be found as a separate file.



ZCCP Documentation, Version 1.0

The remainder of this article will describe ZCCP and how to configure a system
disk to get a fully functional ZPM3/ZCCP system up and running.  BIOS-R6 and
ZPM3 both come with enough documentation to keep you busy for hours, but ZCCP
has never been distributed by itself, because up until this article, there has
not been any documentation for it.  Most of the documentation that follows was
figured out through experimentation and later verified by Simeon Cran.

ZCCP Features

This documentation is provided to assist the user in getting a ZCCP system up
and running.  It is not an exhaustive course on Z- System or ZCPR.  The
following list details which ZCPR features are provided with ZCCP, and which
ones aren't.

    * ZCPR 3.3 compatibility.  ZCCP can run a wide range of utilities an
    applications created for ZCPR 3.3 and ZCPR 3.4.

    * TCAP.  A Z3T termcap file describing terminal characteristics can be
    loaded into the system.  Z-System programs make use of the TCAP for output
    to the screen - a big improvement over the old method of patching
    individual programs with terminal control codes.  TCAP files are loaded by
    the ZCCP LOADSEG command.

    * Named directories.  User areas can be assigned names.  Up to 12 user
    areas can be assigned names.  Named Directory Registers (*.NDR files) are
    loaded by the ZCCP LOADSEG command.

    * Command Search Path.  ZCCP will search for commands along a user defined
    search path.  Up to six path elements (directories) can be defined.

    * Environment block.  Contains TCAP, Named Directory, and Path information. 
    Also includes a map of active disk drives and other system information. 
    The environment block can be viewed with the Z-System SHOW utility.

    * Flow control.  Conditional processing for batch files.  Relies on
    Z-System IF.COM for setting the flow state.  Other flow control commands
    (FI, ELSE, XIF, OR, AND) are resident.

    * Multiple commands can be entered on the command line.  The command line
    buffer will hold up to 225 characters.  Commands should be separated by
    semicolons.

    * Extended Command Processor.  If a command is not a built-in flow command,
    resident command, or located on disk along the search path, the command
    line is passed to an extended command processor.  A typical extended
    command processor is ARUNZ, a sophisticated batch file executor with alias
    features.  To use a program as an extended command processor, rename it to
    CMDRUN.COM and place it in the ROOT directory of your boot disk.

    * Error handler.  In the event that the extended command processor can't
    handle a command, control is passed to an error handler.  Error handlers
    give information about the error (instead of the useless CP/M &quot;?&quot; message)
    and allow the command line to be edited and reused.

    * Resident commands.  The following commands are built in: 
      CLS  - clears the screen 
      NOTE - text following the NOTE command is treated as a comment.
      FI   - Flow control:  terminate the current 
      IF level ELSE - Flow control:  toggle the flow state
      XIF  - Flow control:  exit all pending IF levels 
      OR   - Flow control:  OR IF tests to set flow state 
      AND  - Flow control:  AND IF tests to set flow state

    * Shell stack.  Up to four shell levels can be defined.  Z-System provides
    a choice of several different shells.  Applications such as terminal
    programs and word processors can also be assigned shell status.

    * ZCCP uses the LOADSEG command for direct loading of RSX files that have
    not been GENCOMed.  Example: LOADSEG SAVE.RSX loads SAVE.RSX.

    There are some things that Z3Plus will do that ZCCP won't do.

    - ZCCP does not support a Flow Command Package (FCP).  It relies on the
    transient IF command.  Other flow commands (FI, ELSE, XIF, OR, AND) are
    resident in ZCCP.

    - A Resident Command Package (RCP) is not implemented.  CLS and NOTE are
    resident in ZCCP.  All other commands must be loaded from disk.  This isn't
    as much of a handicap as it might sound if you have a fast RAM drive, such
    as a CBM 17xx REU, Quick Brown Box, or RAMLink.

    - ZCCP can not load type 4 programs (used with ZCPR 3.4).  It loads
    standard COM files at 100H, and type 3 programs that load higher in memory. 
    Most type 4 programs have type 3 or COM equivalents.

    - ZCCP can not reexecute loaded programs.  This trick is usually performed
    on Z-Systems with a GO command that jumps to 100H. Since ZCCP also loads at
    100H, a GO command would only restart ZCCP.


The Files

Three files are included in ZCCP.ARK:

 File name      Size  Description
 ============   ====  ==========================================
 CCP     .COM   3k    ZCCP replacement for CCP.COM
 LOADSEG .COM   3k    Loader for named directories and termcaps
 ZINSTAL .ZPM   1k    Segment containing environment information


Getting Started - Preparing a Boot Disk

Format a Commodore CP/M format 5.25 or 3.5 inch disk.  ZCCP must be booted from
device 8 (CP/M drive A).

Copy the files from ZCCP.ARK to user area 0 of the newly formatted disk.

Copy CPM+.SYS to user 0 of the boot disk.  The CPM+.SYS must have been
generated using the BDOS segments from ZPM3.

Locate a copy of a Z-System alias utility.  A good one is SALIAS16, although
others should work also.  Copy it to user 0 of the boot disk.

At this point, hit the reset switch and boot the system with the new disk. 
After the system boots, you won't be able to do much with it.  The only
resident commands are CLS and NOTE, and ZCCP can only locate commands if they
are prefixed with the drive and user number.

The next step is to create a startup alias.  When ZCCP boots, it looks for a
file named STARTZPM.COM and executes commands from it.  STARTZPM.COM is created
with a ZCPR alias utility.  Here is a listing of a STARTZPM.COM created with
SALIAS:

     =============================================================

     DATE S             ; Set the system time and date.

     ZF                 ; Invoke ZFILER as a shell.

     =============================================================

Of course, your STARTZPM alias will vary depending on the hardware you need to
support, your software preferences, and your work habits.  This alias is close
to the upward size limit that ZCCP can handle based on the capacity of the
multiple command buffer.  At the very least, I recommend an alias that will set
up a search path and load a TCAP.

Actually, I put the cart before the horse in this example.  If you try to
reboot your system with the LOADSEG command as listed, you'll notice that you
don't have a NAMES.NDR file.  There isn't one distributed with ZCCP either. 
Z-System utilities won't let you edit the NDR either, since the buffer for it
hasn't been created yet.  This turned out to be a nasty chicken/egg situation,
hopefully solved by the inclusion of a sample NAMES.NDR file containing simply
A0:SYSTEM and A15:ROOT.

At this point, you should have a mostly functioning ZCCP system disk.  Press
reset and boot it up.  You might want to correct any problems with it or tweak
it to perfection before moving on.


List of Z-System Utilities for ZCCP

Some of the following utilities are essential, others are nice to have.  The
version numbers listed are the latest known versions at the time that this
documentation was written.  Utilities can be found on ZNode BBSs, and some of
them are available on Simtel20 or its mirror sites.  Some of the more important
utilities will be uploaded to cco.caltech.edu.

         SALIAS16  - already mentioned in the example above.  SALIAS (or one of
         the other ZCPR alias utilities) are essential.

         ARCOPY    - not a ZCPR utility, but one of the best CP/M file copiers
         ever.

         SD138B    - excellent DIRectory utility.  SD offers many different
         types of sorts, list formats, etc., displays date stamps, and supports
         output to a file.

         MKDIR32   - utility for manipulating directory names and Named
         Directory Register (*.NDR) files.

         ERASE57   - erases files.

         ZFILER10  - a file management shell that can launch applications. It
         is programmable in that it can execute user defined macros from a
         file.  Multiple files can be &quot;tagged&quot; and operated on by other
         programs.  ZFILER is an excellent program, sort of a GUI desktop
         without the slow graphics.

         C128-XGR  - a library of eXtended GRaphics termcaps for the C128. This
         file is essential if you want to use any ZCPR programs that need a
         TCAP.  These termcaps are the first for the C128 that implement
         character graphics, standout mode, and control of blinking reverse,
         and underline modes.

         SETPTH10  - used to set the command search path.  Essential!

         VERROR17  - error handler that displays the command line for
         reediting.  VERROR17 is the only error handler that I found that works
         with ZCCP.

         ZEX50     - Z-System EXecutive is a powerful batch file processor that
         replaces the CP/M SUBMIT command.

         LBRHLP22  - Z-System Help utility displays help files.  Help files can
         be crunched (*.HZP), and/or loaded from a HELP.LBR library.

         ARUNZ09   - runs an alias script from a text file.  ARUNZ is
         frequently used as an extended command processor.  To use ARUNZ (or
         any other executable utility) as an extended command processor, rename
         it to CMDRUN.COM.

         VLU102    - Video Library Utility views or extracts files from
         libraries.  Versions of VLU above 1.02 do not work reliably with
         ZPM3/ZCCP.

         Z33IF16   - is the IF.COM discussed in the section on flow control.

         SHOW14    - displays an immense amount of information about your
         Z-System.  SHOW also includes a memory patching function.

         ZCNFG24   - configures Z-System program options.  Most Z-System
         programs are distributed with a configuration (*.CFG) file that
         produces a menu of configuration options when run with ZCNFG.

         ZP17      - Z-System Patch utility edits files, disk sectors, or
         memory, and includes a built-in RPN calculator and number base
         converter.

         ZMAN-NEW  - This is a manual describing Z-System features in depth. 
         It is based on earlier versions of Z-System, and is a little dated,
         but otherwise contains information that you won't find anywhere else. 
         Not everything in the manual applies to operation of ZPM3/ZCCP, but
         with the documentation presented here, you should be able to get a
         good idea of what works and what doesn't.


ZCCP Technical Notes

ZCCP is a replacement CCP that implements ZCPR 3.3.  It loads at 100H and is
stored in the bank 0 CCP buffer for fast reloading as does the standard CCP. 
By contrast, Z3Plus loads into high memory and can be overwritten by transient
commands, requiring reloading Z3Plus from disk.  Because ZCCP replaces the CCP,
a ZCCP system has more TPA (transient program area) than a Z3Plus system.  A
ZCCP system on the C128 has more than 57K of TPA, almost the same amount as a
standard C128 CP/M system.
         
This should be enough information to get started with ZPM3/ZCCP. Set up a boot
disk, experiment with some Z-System utilities, read ZMAN-NEW, and get some
applications running.  You'll agree that ZPM3/ZCCP breaths new life into CP/M.

Multi-Tasking on the C=128 - Part 1
by Craig Taylor (duck@pembvax1.pembroke.edu)

I.    Introduction / Package Over-view..

 This article will detail the multi-tasking kernal which I have written butt
 is still in the debugging stage . The documentation is being released now as
 C= Hacking has been delayed for a month while this article and a few others
 were in the process of being shaped. The source code listings, binaries, and
 a few sample programs will be in the next issue of C= Hacking as well as
 available on the mailserver and on R. Knop's FTP site when they are
 available..

 The Commodore 128 does not support TRUE multi-tasking in that the processor
 handles swapping from task to task. Rather the package will make use of the
 interrupts occuring sixty times a second to determine when to switch tasks..
 The Commodore 128 greatly simplifies things as in addation to the interrupts
 it also has the provision to relocate zero page and the stack page. So the
 package basically works by intercepting the IRQ vector, taking a look at the
 current job, saving the stack pointer, finding the next active job, loading
 the stack page and registers and resuming the normal IRQ as if nothing had
 ever happened.

 Unfortunatly Commodore never thought of having multiple programs in memory
 executing at any given time. Hence, problems will occur with file accesses,
 with memory contention, and with an over-all slowdown in speed. The package
 will detail how to handle device contentions, but it's recommended that
 programmers make use of the C= 128 kernal call LKUPLA $ff59 containing the
 logical file number they wish to use in .A; if the carry flag is set upon
 return then it is safe to use, else find another one as another program is
 using it. However, note that if you have multiple programs doing this then
 you may have problems with one grabbing a logical file number after the
 other process has checked for it. Multi-tasking is fun 'eh?  Problems like
 this will be examined when we get into semaphores later in this article..

 Craig Bruce's Dynamic Memory Allocation article in the second issue of C=
 Hacking should provide a very strong basis for a full-blown memoryy manager.
 With minor modifications (basically just changing the initial allocations so
 that the package is not killed) it should be able to work.  Also it will need
 changes to make sure that processes don't try to allocate at the same time.
 So a memory manager is not too much of a problem. Details of what changes
 will be necessary shall be in the next issue.

 What is a process? What is a program? I've been using the terms almost
 inter-changebly throughout this article at this point. Basically I'm calling
 them the same. A process, or program is defined as a program with it's own
 executable section, it's own data sections, and it's own stack and zero page.
 (Note, however, that the multi-tasking package does not support relocation of
 the zero page although this is likely to change).  The &quot;kernal&quot; of the
 multi-tasker is basically that part of the package which governs which
 process is executed or switched to next. Semaphores will be examined in
 detail later; they function as flags for processes too know when it is safe
 to execute something, and serve as signals betweenn them.

 Future versions of the package, (even though I know it does not exist out
 side of my house yet), will support pipes and a more strongly typed kernal
 so that processes may be prioritized.

II.   A Look At Multi-Tasking

 The introduction introduced some basic elements of multi-tasking but I'll
 repeat them here, defining them so that this article can be clear as some of
 the concepts can get a bit confusing.

    Background - A process is said to be in the &quot;backgr ound&quot; if it is not
    the foreground task and may or may not have input devi ces associated
    with it.

    Foreground - A process is said to be &quot;foreground&quot; if it is the main
    active process and is holding the keyboard and screen display captive
    (ie: the user is actually working within it).
  
    Kernal  - A small section of code that performs low-leval work that is 
    needed by any programs in memory..

    Multi-Tasking - Execution of more than one process at any given
    time.

    Priority - A value associated with each process that determines how
    often, and possibly when a process is executed.

    Process - The space in memory taken up by executable program code, any
    associated data, the stack and the registers associated and currently in
    use by it, including the current PC (program counter)..

    Semaphores - Values that are globally accessed by processes to share and
    communicate information between each other and the kernal.

 Some CPU's have available a multi- tasking mode (the 386 and 486 are the
 most famaliar ones that come to mind), y et the 8502 chip contained inside
 the Commodore 128 was first designed before 1985 and lacks multi-tasking. It
 would be nice if such a multi-tasking CPU in the 6502 family did exist but
 it would also create problems with the 6502 style architecture and wouldd
 produce severe compatibility problems.

 So how is the C=128 supposed to do multi-tasking? Well, we'll &quot;simulate&quot;
 it..

 Basically if we had two programs in machine language:

            Program 1:                            Program 2:
          - lda #65    ; the &quot;A&quot; character     - lda #64    ; the &quot;@&quot; character
            jsr $ffd2  ; print it                jsr $ffd2  ; print it
            jmp -                                jmp --

 And we wanted them to multi-task we'd expect something like the following:

@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@A@AA

 It's unlikely that you'll get that in many multi-tasking environments,
 even non-simulated ones. Since we're only going to be switching tasks every
 1/60 of a second then we're more likely to see an output similair to this:

@@@@@@AAAAAAA@@@@@@@AAAAAAA@@@@@@@@AAAAAAA@@@@@@@AAAAAAAA@@@@@@@@AAAAAA@@@@@@@

 So that it seems a process will run for about 1/60 of a second beforee
 switching to the next one.
  
 We run into problems however. The KERNAL in the C128 that contains most
 off the file handling, screen manipulations, and keyboard input routines. It
 was never designed with the idea of multi-tasking in mind. So we're gonna
 have code running in the KERNAL in two spots for the two differant processes
 and it's more than likely we'll end up with something like:

@@@@@@@@&lt;and then a BRK or some strange error or never-never-land&gt;&gt;

  There's got to be some way to fix it - There is - It's called a semaphore..

 A semaphore is a value that is checked before access is granted to another
 group of memory locations. The semaphore is basically requested via the
 following:

        request_semaphore       sei
                                ldx semaphore
                                dex
                                beq +
                                cli
                              - ldy #$ff
                                dey 
                                bne -
                              + inc semaphore
                                cli

 Now the request_semaphore has to disable interrupts to prevent another task
 from changing the semaphore value before this routine has had a chance. The
 actual code for the request_semaphore will be very similair to the above.

 Using a similair routine that performs the opposite - setting the semaphore
 to a zero value when finished we can dictate what program has control over
 what device or what memory areas.

 The semaphores will be used to govern access to the KERNAL routines which
 manipulate the locations in zero page etc, they'll also be used to manage the
 memory manager when it is implemented as it'd be awkward for it to allocate
 the same block of memory to two or more processes.

IV.   Availibility of the Packagee

The package should be available at the time of the next issue. A further
examination of how the routines work shall be examined along with the source
code.

Errors popped up in developing it and rather than delay C= Hacking any
further I decided to go ahead and release the above information so that
individuals can start developing appropriate routines. In addition,
please note that PIPEs _may_ or may not be supported in the next issue.
I have not fully made up my mind yet on them.

LITTLE RED READER: MS-DOS file reader/WRITER for the C128 and 1571/81.
by Craig Bruce  (csbruce@neumann.uwaterloo.ca)

1. INTRODUCTION

This article is a continuation of the Little Red Reader article from last
issue.  The program has been extended to write MS-DOS files, in addition to
reading them.  The program still works drive-to-drive so you'll still need two
disk drives (either physical or logical) to use it.  The program has also been
extended to allow MS-DOS files to be deleted and to allow the copying of
Commodore-DOS files between CBM-DOS disks (this makes it more convenient to
use the program with a temporary logical drive like RAMDOS).  Also, since I
have recently acquired a CMD FD-4000 floppy disk drive, I know that this
program works with MS-DOS disks with this drive (but only for the 720K
format).

The program still has the same organization as last time: a menu-oriented
user-interface program written in BASIC that makes use of a package of MS-DOS
disk accessing routines written in machine language.  Oh, this program is
Public Domain Software, so feel free to distribute and/or mangle it as you
wish.  Just note any manglings on the &quot;initializing&quot; screen so people don't
blame me.

The program runs on either the 40 or 80-column screens, but you will get
much better performance from the BASIC portion of the program by being
in 80-column mode and FAST mode.  A modification that someone might want
to make would be to spread-out the display for the 80-column screen and add
color to the rather bland display.

2. USER GUIDE

LOAD and RUN the &quot;lrr.128&quot; BASIC program file.  When the program is first run,
it will display an &quot;initializing&quot; message and will load in the binary machine
language package from the &quot;current&quot; Commodore DOS drive (the current drive is
obtained from PEEK(186) - the last device accessed).  The binary package is
loaded only on the first run and is not reloaded on subsequent runs if the
package ID field is in place.

The system is designed to have two file selection menus: one for the MS-DOS
disk drive, and one for the Commodore-DOS disk drive (which may be a logical
disk drive).  The idea for copying is that you select the files in one of
these menus, and then program knows to copy them to the disk for the other
menu.  This idea of having two selection menus is also very consistent with
the original program.

2.1. MS-DOS MENU

When the program starts, the MS-DOS menu of the program is displayed.  It
looks like:

   MS-DOS  MS=10:1581  CBM=8  FREE=715000

   NUM  S  TRN  TYP  FILENAME  EXT  LENGTH
   ---  -  ---  ---  --------  ---  ------
     1  *  ASC  SEQ  HACK4     TXT  120732
     2     BIN  PRG  RAMDOS    SFX   34923

   D=DIR M=MSDEV F=CBMDEV C=COPY Q=QUIT
   T=TOGGLE R=REMOVE X=CBMCPY /=MENU +-=PG

except that immediately after starting up, &quot;&lt;directory not loaded&gt;&quot; will be
displayed rather than filenames.  The menu looks and operates pretty much as
it did in the last issue of C= Hacking.  The only differences are that the
number of bytes free on the drive are displayed (which is useful to know when
writing files) and there are some more commands.

The directory (&quot;D&quot;), change ms-dos device (&quot;M&quot;), change commodore file device
(&quot;F&quot;), toggle column contents (&quot;T&quot;), copy ms-dos files to cbm-dos disk (&quot;C&quot;),
quit (&quot;Q&quot;), paging (&quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;), column change (SPACE or RETURN), and the
cursor movement commands all work the same as before.  They are all sticks to
use to flog the beast into submission.  The new commands are: &quot;R&quot; (remove ==
delete), &quot;/&quot; (change menu), and &quot;X&quot; (copy CBM files == &quot;Xerox&quot;).

The remove command is used to delete selected files from the MS-DOS disk.
After selecting this option, you will get an annoying &quot;are you sure&quot; question
and the the selected files will quickly disappear and the changes will finally
be written to disk.  Deleting a batch of MS-DOS files is much quicker than
deleting Commodore-DOS files since MS-DOS disks use a File Allocation Table
rather than the linked list of blocks organization that CBM uses.  In order to
make the BASIC program execute quicker, after deleting, the original order of
the filenames in the directory listing will be changed.  Be forewarned that
the delete operation is non-recoverable.

The change menu command is used to move back and forth between the Commodore-
DOS and MS-DOS menus.

2.2. COMMODORE-DOS MENU

The Commodore-DOS menu, which displays the names of the Commodore files
selected for various operations, looks and works pretty much the same as
the MS-DOS menu:

   CBMDOS  MS=10:1581  CBM=8  FREE=3211476

   NUM  S  TRN  FILENAME         T  LENGTH
   ---  -  ---  ---------------- -  ------
     1  *  BIN  LRR-128          P    9876
     2     ASC  COM-HACKING-005  S  175412

   D=DIR M=MSDEV F=CBMDEV C=COPY Q=QUIT
   T=TOGGLE R=REMOVE X=CBMCPY /=MENU +-=PG

You'll notice, however, that the filetype field (&quot;T&quot; here) is moved and is
unchangable.  Also, the file lengths are not exact; they are reported as the
block count of the file multiplied by 254.  This menu is not maintained for
files being copied to the CBM-DOS disk from an MS-DOS disk.  You'll
have to re-execute the Directory instruction to get an updated listing.

The &quot;D&quot; (directory) command has local effect when in this menu.  The
Commodore-DOS directory will be loaded from the current CBM device number.
Note that in order for this to work, the CBM device must be number eight
or greater (a disk drive).  Originally, the subroutine for this command was
written using only GET#'s from the disk and was very slow.  It was modified,
however, to call a machine language subroutine to read the information for
a directory entry from the directory listing, and hence the subroutine now
operates at a tolerable speed.

The &quot;C&quot; (copy) command also has a different meaning when in this menu.  It
means to copy the selected CBM files to the MS-DOS disk.  See details below.

The copy CBM files (&quot;X&quot;) command is used to copy the files in the CBM-DOS menu
to another CBM-DOS disk unit.  Select the files you want to copy and then
press X.  You will then be asked what device number you want to copy the files
to.  The device can be another disk drive or any other device (except the
keyboard).  Using device number 0 does not mean the &quot;null&quot; device as it does
with copying MS-DOS to CBM.  If you are copying to a disk device and the file
already exists, then you will be asked if you wish to overwrite the file.  You
cannot copy to the same disk unit.  Also, all files are copied in binary mode
(regardless of what translation you have selected for a file).

The copy CBM files command was included since all of the low-level gear
needed to implement it (specifically &quot;commieIn&quot; and &quot;commieOut&quot; below) was
also required by other functions.  This command can be very convenient when
working with RAMDOS.  For example, if you only had a 1571 as device 8 but you
have a RAM expander and have installed RAMDOS as device 9, then you would
copy MS-DOS files to RAMDOS using the MS-DOS menu, and then you would go to
the Commodore-DOS menu (&quot;/&quot;), read the directory, select all files, insert an
Commodore-DOS diskette into your 1571, and then use &quot;X&quot; to copy from the
RAMDOS device to the 1571.

The remove command (&quot;R&quot;) does not work for this directory.  You can SCRATCH
your CBM-DOS files your damn self.

2.3. COPY CBM-DOS TO MS-DOS

Before you can copy selected CBM-DOS files to an MS-DOS disk, the MS-DOS disk
directory must be already loaded (from the MS-DOS menu).  This is required
since the directory and FAT information are kept in memory at all times during
the execution of this program.

When you enter copy mode, the screen will clear and the name of each selected
file is displayed as it is being copied.  If an error is encountered on either
the MS-DOS or CBM-DOS drive during copying, an error message will be displayed
and copying will continue (after you press a key for MS-DOS errors).  Please
note that not a whole lot of effort was put into error recovery.

To generate an MS-DOS filename from an CBM-DOS filename, the following
algorithm is used.  The filename is searched from right to left for the last
&quot;.&quot; character.  If there is no &quot;.&quot; character, then the entire filename, up to
11 characters, is used as the MS-DOS filename.  Characters 9 to 11 will be
used as the extension.  If there is a &quot;.&quot; character, the all characters before
it, up to eight, will be used as the MS-DOS filename and all characters after
the final &quot;.&quot;, up to three, will be used as the MS-DOS extension.

Then, the newly generated MS-DOS filename is scanned for any extra &quot;.&quot;
characters or embedded spaces.  If any are found, they are replaced by the
underscore character (&quot;_&quot;, which is the backarrow character on a Commodore
display).  Finally, all trailing underscores are removed from the end of both
the filename and extension portions of the MS-DOS filename.  Also, all
characters are converted to lowercase PETSCII (which is uppercase ASCII) when
they are copied into the MS-DOS filename.  Note that if the Commodore filename
is not in the 8/3 format of MS-DOS, then something in the name may be lost.
Some examples of filename conversion follow:

CBM-DOS FILENAME       MS-DOS FILENAME
----------------       ---------------
&quot;lrr.bin&quot;              &quot;lrr.bin&quot;
&quot;lrr.128.bin&quot;          &quot;lrr_128.bin&quot;
&quot;hello there.text&quot;     &quot;hello_th.tex&quot;
&quot;long_filename&quot;        &quot;long_fil.ena&quot;
&quot;file 1..3.s__5&quot;       &quot;file_1.s&quot;

It would have been time-consuming to have the program scan the MS-DOS
directory for a filename already existing on the disk, so LRR will put
multiple files on a disk with the same filename without complaining.  This
also gets rid of the problem of asking you if you want to overwrite the old
file or generate a new name.  However, in order to retrieve the file from
disk on an MS-DOS machine, you will probably have to use the RENAME command to
rename the first versions of the file on the disk to something else so MS-DOS
will scan further in the directory for the last version of the file with the
same filename.  There is no rename command in LRR because I never thought of
it in time.  It would have been fairly easy to put in.

The date generated for a new MS-DOS file will be all zeros.  Some systems
interpret this as 12:00 am, 01-Jan-80 and others don't display a date at all
for this value.

The physical copying of the file is done completely in machine language and
nothing is displayed on the screen while this is happening, but you can follow
things by looking at the blinking lights and listening for clicks and grinds.

Since the FAT and directory are maintained in RAM during the entire copying
process and are only flushed to disk after the entire batch of files are
copied, copying is made more efficient, since there will be no costly seek
back to track 0 after writing each file (like MS-DOS does).  If you have a
number of small files to copy, then they will be knocked off in quick
succession, faster than many MS-DOS machines will copy them.

To simplify the implementation, the current track of disk blocks for writing
is not maintained like it is for reading.  Also, a writing interleave of 1:1
is used for a 1571, which is not optimal.  However, since writing is such a
slow operation anyway, and since the 1571 is particularly bad by insisting on
verifying blocks, not much more overhead is introduced than is already
present.

An interesting note about writing MS-DOS disks is that you can terminate LRR
in the middle of a copy (with STOP+RESTORE) or in the middle of copying a
batch of files, and the MS-DOS disk will remain in a perfectly consistent
state afterwards.  The state will be as if none of the files were copied.  The
reason is that the control information (the FAT and directory) is maintained
internally and is flushed only after copying is all completed.  But don't
terminate LRR while it is flushing the control information.

Here is a table of copying speeds for copying to 1571, 1581, and CMD FD-4000
disk units with ASC and BIN translation modes.  All figures are in bytes/
second, which includes both reading the byte from a C= disk and writing it to
the MS-DOS disk.  The average speed for either the read or write operation
individually will be twice the speed given below.  These results were obtained
from copying a 156,273 byte text file (the text of C= Hacking Issue #4).

   FROM   \ TO: FD-bin     FD-asc     81-bin     81-asc     71-bin     71-asc
   --------+    ------     ------     ------     ------     ------     ------
   RAMLink |     2,332      2,200      2,332      2,200      1,594      1,559
   RAMDOS  |     1,070      1,053      1,604      1,600      1,561      1,510
   FD4000  |         -          -      1,645      1,597      1,499      1,464
   JD1581  |     1,662      1,619          -          -      1,474      1,440
   JD1571  |     1,050      1,024        953        933          -          -

These figures are for transfer speed only, not counting the couple of seconds
of opening files and flushing the directory.  Note that all my physical drives
are JiffyDOS-ified, so your performance may be slower.  I am at a loss to
explain why an FD-4000 is so much slower than a 1581 for copying from a
RAMDOS file, but the same speed or better for copying from anything else.

Since I don't have access to an actual MS-DOS machine, I have not tested the
files written onto an MS-DOS disk by LRR, except by reading them back with LRR
and BBR.  I do know, however, that earlier encarnations of this program did
work fine with MS-DOS machines.

3. MS-DOS ROOT DIRECTORY

It was brought to my attention that I made a mistake in the pervious article.
I was wrong about the offset of the attributes field in a directory entry.
The layout should have been as follows:

   OFFSET     LEN     DESCRIPTION
   ------     ---     -----------
     0..7       8     Filename
    8..10       3     Extension
       11       1     Attributes: $10=Directory, $08=VolumeId
   12..21      10     &lt;unused&gt;
   22..25       4     Date
   26..27       2     Starting FAT entry number
   28..31       4     File length in bytes

4. FILE COPYING PACKAGE

As was mentioned above, Little Red Reader is split into two pieces: a BASIC
front-end user interface program and a package of machine language subroutines
for disk accessing.  The BASIC program handles the menu, user interaction, and
most of the MS-DOS directory searching/modifying.  The machine language
package handles the hardware input/output, File Allocation Table and file
structure manipulations.

The file copying package is written in assembly language and is loaded into
memory at address $8000 on bank 0 and requires about 13K of memory.  The
package is loaded at this high address to be out of the way of the main BASIC
program, even if RAMDOS is installed.

This section of the article is presented in its entirety, including all of the
information given last time.

4.1. INTERFACE

The subroutine call interface to the file copying package is summarized as
follows:

   ADDRESS     DESCRIPTION
   -------     -----------
   PK          initPackage subroutine
   PK+3        msDir    (load MS-DOS directory/FAT) subroutine
   PK+6        msRead   (copy MS-DOS to CBM-DOS) subroutine
   PK+9        msWrite  (copy CBM-DOS to MS-DOS) subroutine
   PK+12       msFlush  subroutine
   PK+15       msDelete subroutine
   PK+18       msFormat subroutine [not implemented]
   PK+21       msBytesFree subroutine
   PK+24       cbmCopy  (copy CBM-DOS to CBM-DOS) subroutine
   PK+27       cbmDirent (read CBM-DOS directory entry) subroutine

where &quot;PK&quot; is the load address of the package ($8000).

The parameter passing interface is summarized as follows:

   ADDRESS     DESCRIPTION
   -------     -----------
   PV          two-byte package identification number ($CB, 132)
   PV+2        errno : error code returned
   PV+3        MS-DOS device number (8 to 30)
   PV+4        MS-DOS device type ($00=1571, $FF=1581)
   PV+5        two-byte starting cluster number for file copying
   PV+7        low and mid bytes of file length for copying
   PV+9        pointer to MS-DOS directory entry for writing
   PV+11       CBM-DOS file block count
   PV+13       CBM-DOS file type (&quot;S&quot;=seq, &quot;P&quot;=prg, etc.)
   PV+14       CBM-DOS filename length
   PV+15       CBM-DOS filename characters (max 16 chars)

Where &quot;PV&quot; is equal to PK+30.  Additional subroutine parameters are passed in
the processor registers.

The MS-DOS device number and device type interface variables allow you to set
the MS-DOS drive and the package identification number allows the application
program to check if the package is already loaded into memory so that it only
has to load the package the first time the application is run and not on
re-runs.  The identification sequence is a value of $CB followed by a value of
132.

4.1.1. INIT_PACKAGE SUBROUTINE

The &quot;initPackage&quot; subroutine should be called when the package is first
installed, whenever the MS-DOS device number is changed, and whenever a new
disk is mounted to invalidate the internal track cache.  It requires no
parameters.

4.1.2. MS_DIR SUBROUTINE

The &quot;msDir&quot; subroutine will load the directory, FAT, and the Boot Sector
parameters into the internal memory of the package from the current MS-DOS
device number.  No (other) input parameters are needed and the subroutine
returns a pointer to the directory space in the .AY registers and the number
of directory entries in the .X register.  If an error occurs, then the
subroutine returns with the Carry flag set and the error code is available in
the &quot;errno&quot; interface variable.  The directory entry data is in the directory
space as it was read in raw from the directory sectors on the MS-DOS disk.

4.1.3. MS_READ SUBROUTINE

The &quot;msRead&quot; subroutine will copy a single file from the MS-DOS disk to a
specified CBM-Kernal logical file number (the CBM file must already be
opened).  If the CBM logical file number is zero, then the file data is simply
discarded after it is read from the MS-DOS file.  The starting cluster number
of the file to copy and the low and mid bytes of the file length are passed in
the PV+5 and PV+7 interface words.  The translation mode to use is passed in
the .A register ($00=binary, $FF=ascii) and the CBM logical file number to
output to is passed in the .X register.  If an error occurs, the routine
returns with the Carry flag set and the error code in the &quot;errno&quot; interface
variable.  There are no other output parameters.

Note that since the starting cluster number and low-file length of the file to
be copied are required rather than the filename, it is the responsibility of
the front-end application program to dig through the raw directory sector data
to get this information.  The application must also open the Commodore-DOS
file of whatever filetype on whatever device is required; the package does not
need to know the Commodore-DOS device number.

4.1.4. MS_WRITE SUBROUTINE

The &quot;msWrite&quot; subroutine copies a single file from a specified CBM-Kernal
logical file number to a MS-DOS file.  The MS-DOS device number and type are
set above.  A pointer to the MS-DOS directory entry in the buffer returned by
the &quot;msDir&quot; call must be given in interface word PV+9 and the translation mode
and CBM lfn are passed in the .A and .X registers as in the &quot;msRead&quot; routine.
An error return is given in the usual way (.CS, errno).  Otherwise, there are
no return values.

It is the responsibility of the calling program to initialize the MS-DOS
directory entry to all zeros and then set the filename and set the starting
cluster pointer to $0FFF.  This routine will update the starting cluster and
file length fields of the directory entry when it finishes.  The internal
&quot;dirty flags&quot; are modified so that the directory and FAT will be flushed on
the next call to &quot;msFlush&quot;.

4.1.5. MS_FLUSH SUBROUTINE

The &quot;msFlush&quot; subroutine takes no input parameters other than the implicit
msDevice and msType.  If &quot;dirty&quot; (modified), the FAT will be written to the
MS-DOS disk, to both physical replicas of the disk FAT.  Then, each directory
sector that is dirty will be written to disk.  After flushing, the internal
dirty flags will be cleared.  An error return is given in the usual way.
There are no other output parameters.  If you call this routine and there are
no dirty flags set, then it will return immediately, without any writing to
disk.

4.1.6. MS_DELETE SUBROUTINE

The &quot;msDelete&quot; subroutine will deallocate all File Allocation Table entries
(and hence, data clusters) allocated to a file and mark the directory entry as
being deleted (by putting an $E5 into the first character of the filename).
The file is specified by giving the pointer to the directory entry in
interface word at PV+9.  After deallocating the file data, the internal
&quot;dirty&quot; flag will be set for the FAT and the sector that the directory entry
is on, but nothing will be written to disk.  There is no error return from
this routine.  It is the responsibility of the calling routine to eventually
call the &quot;msFlush&quot; routine.

4.1.7. MS_FORMAT SUBROUTINE

The &quot;msFormat&quot; subroutine is not implemented.  It's intended function was to
format the MS-DOS disk and generate and write the boot sector, initial FAT,
and initial directory entry data.

4.1.8. MS_BYTES_FREE SUBROUTINE

The &quot;msBytesFree&quot; subroutine will scan the currently loaded MS-DOS File
Allocation Table, count the number of clusters free, and return the number of
bytes free for file storage on the disk.  There are no input parameters and
the bytes free are returned in the .AYX registers (.A=low, .Y=mid, .X=high
byte).  The subroutine has no error returns and does not check if an MS-DOS
directory is actually loaded.

4.1.9. CBM_COPY SUBROUTINE

The &quot;cbmCopy&quot; subroutine will copy from an input CBM-Kernal logical file
number given in the .A register to an output CBM-Kernal lfn given in the .X
register, in up to 1024 byte chunks.  File contents are copied exactly (no
translation).  This routine does not care if the lfn's are on the same device
or not, but the input device must be a disk unit (either logical or physical).
An error return is given in the usual way.

4.1.10. CBM_DIRENT SUBROUTINE

The &quot;cbmDirent&quot; subroutine reads the next directory entry from the CBM-Kernal
lfn given in .A and puts the data into interface variables.  Of course, the
lfn is assumed to be open for reading a directory (&quot;$&quot;).  The block count is
returned in the word at PV+11, the first character of the filetype is returned
at PV+13, the number of characters in the filename is returned in PV+14, and
the filename characters are returned in bytes PV+15 to PV+30.  An error return
is given in the usual way.

This routine assumes that the first two bytes of the directory file have
already been read.  The first call to this routine will return the name of the
disk.  The end of a directory is signalled by a filename length of zero.  In
this case, the block count returned will be the number of blocks free on the
disk.

4.2. IMPLEMENTATION

This section presents the code that implements the MS-DOS file reading and
writing package.  It is here in a special form; each code line is preceded by
the % symbol.  The % sign is there to allow you to easily extract the
assembler code from the rest of this magazine (and all of my ugly comments).
On a Unix system, all you have to do is execute the following command line
(substitute filenames as appropriate):

grep '^%' Hack5 | sed 's/^% //' | sed 's/^%//' &gt;lrr.s

% ; Little Red Reader/Writer utility package by Craig Bruce, 31-Jan-92

The code is written for the Buddy assembler and here are a couple setup

This next level of routines deals with logical sectors and the track cache
rather than with hardware.

% ;====logical sector level====
%

Invalidate the track cache if the MS-DOS drive number is changed or if a new
disk is inserted.  This routine has to establish a RAM configuration of $0E
since it will be called from RAM0.  Configuration $0E gives RAM0 from $0000 to
$BFFF, Kernal ROM from $C000 to $FFFF, and the I/O space over the Kernal from
$D000 to $DFFF.  This configuration is set by all application interface
subroutines.

% initPackage = *

%    bpl -
%    sta fatDirty
%    clc
%    rts
%

Locate a sector (block) in the track cache, or read the corresponding physical
track into the track cache if necessary.  This routine accepts the cylinder,
side, and sector numbers of the block.

% sectorSave = 5
%
% readBlock = *  ;( .A=cylinder,.X=side,.Y=sector ) : .AY=blkPtr,.CS=err

Check if the correct track is in the track cache.

%    cmp bufCylinder
%    bne readBlockPhysical
%    cpx bufSide
%    bne readBlockPhysical

If so, then locate the sector's address and return that.

%    asl
%    clc
%    adc #&gt;trackbuf
%    tay
%    lda #&lt;trackbuf
%    clc
%    rts
%

Here, we have to read the physical track into the track cache.  We save the
input parameters and call the hardware-level track-reading routine.

%    readBlockPhysical = *
%    sta bufCylinder
%    stx bufSide
%    sty sectorSave
%    jsr readTrack

Check for errors.

%    bcc readBlockPhysicalOk
%    lda errno
%    and #$0f
%    cmp #11    ;disk change
%    beq +
%    sec
%    rts

If the error that happened is a &quot;Disk Change&quot; error, then mount the disk and
try to read the physical track again.

% +  jsr mountDisk
%    lda bufCylinder
%    ldx bufSide
%    ldy sectorSave
%    bcc readBlockPhysical
%    rts
%

Here, the physical track has been read into the track cache ok, so we recover
the original input parameters and try the top of the routine again.

%    readBlockPhysicalOk = *
%    lda bufCylinder
%    ldx bufSide
%    ldy sectorSave
%    jmp readBlock
%

Divide the given number by 18.  This is needed for the calculations to convert
a logical sector number to the corresponding physical cylinder, side, and
sector numbers that the lower-level routines require.  The method of repeated
subtraction is used.  This routine would probably work faster if we tried to
repeatedly subtract 360 (18*20) at the top, but I didn't bother.

% divideBy18 = *  ;( .AY=number ) : .A=quotient, .Y=remainder

Convert the given logical block number to the corresponding physical cylinder,
side, and sector numbers.  This routine follows the formulae given in the
previous article with a few simplifying tricks.

%    rts
%

Copy a sequential group of logical sectors into memory.  This routine is used
by the directory loading routine to load the FAT and Root Directory, and is
used by the cluster reading routine to retrieve all of the blocks of a
cluster.  After the given starting logical sector number is converted into its
physical cylinder, side, and sector equivalent, the physical values are
incremented to get the address of successive sectors of the group.  This
avoids the overhead of the logical to physical conversion.  Quite a number of
temporaries are needed.

% destPtr = 6

% curSide = 9
% curSector = 10

instruction in half.  (A cycle saved... you know).

This routine locates the given FAT table entry number and returns the value
stored in it.  Some work is needed to deal with the 12-bit compressed data
structure.

% locateFatEntry = *  ;( .AY=fatEntryNumber ) : entryAddr, entryBits%1

Divide the FAT entry number by two and multiply by three because two FAT
entries are stored in three bytes.  Then add the FAT base address and we have
the address of the three bytes that contain the FAT entry we are interested
in.  I retrieve the three bytes into zero-page memory for easy manipulation.

Copy the given cluster to the CBM output file.  This routine fetches the next
cluster of the file for the next time this routine is called, and if it hits
the NULL pointer of the last cluster of a file, it adjusts the number of valid
file data bytes the current cluster contains to FileLength % ClusterLength
(see note below).

This is the translation table used to convert from ASCII to PETSCII.  You can
modify it to suit your needs if you wish.  If you cannot reassemble this file,
then you can sift through the binary file and locate the table and change it
there.  An entry of $00 means the corresponding ASCII character will not be
translated.  You'll notice that I have set up translations for the following
ASCII control characters into PETSCII: Backspace, Tab, Linefeed (CR), and
Formfeed.  I also translate the non-PETSCII characters such as {, |, ~, and _
according to what they probably would have been if Commodore wasn't so
concerned with the graphics characters.

This is the translation table used to convert from PETSCII to ASCII.  You can
modify it to suit your needs, similar to the ASCII to PETSCII table.  An entry
of $00 means the corresponding PETSCII character will not be translated.
You'll notice that I have set up translations for the following PETSCII
control characters into ASCII: Delete (into Backspace), Tab, Carriage Return
(into CR+LF), and ClearScreen (into Fordfeed).  Appropriate translations into
the ASCII characters {, }, ^, _, ~, \, and | are also set up.

% ;====bss storage (size=11,264 bytes)====

This is where the track cache, etc. are stored.  This section requires 11K of
storage space but does not increase the length of the binary program file
since these storage areas are DEFINED rather than allocated with &quot;.buf&quot;
directives.  The Unix terminology for this type of uninitialized data is
&quot;bss&quot;.

% bss = *
% trackbuf   = bss
% clusterBuf = trackbuf+4608

5. USER-INTERFACE PROGRAM

This section presents the listing of the user-interface BASIC program.  You
should be aware that you can easily change some of the defaults to your own
preferences if you wish.  In particular, you may wish to change the &quot;dv&quot; and
&quot;dt&quot; variables in lines 25 and 26.  This program is not listed in the &quot;%&quot;
format that the assembler listing is since you can recover this listing from
the uuencoded binary program file.  The listing is here in its entirety.

6. UUENCODED FILES

Here are the binary executables in uuencoded form.  The CRC32s of the two
files are as follows:

crc32 = 3896271974 for &quot;lrr-128&quot;
crc32 = 2918283051 for &quot;lrr.bin&quot;

The &quot;lrr.128&quot; file is the main BASIC program and the &quot;lrr.bin&quot; file contains
the machine lanugage disk-accessing routines.

7. THE FUTURE

Future improvements to this program would include implementation of MS-DOS
formatting, more file manipluation commands (such as Rename), re-writing the
user-interface BASIC program in machine language, and making a file buffering
facility for those people with only one disk drive.  However, I don't intend
to do much more to this program.  My intentions are to put this functionality
into a device driver for a new operating system (or at least, operating
environment) for the C-128.  Anyone else is free to improve this program.

=============================================================================
In the Next Issue:

TWO-KEY ROLLOVER

This article will examine how a two-key rollover mechanism would work for the
keyboards of the C-128 and 64 and will present Kernal-wedge implementations
for both machines.  Webster's doesn't seem to know, so I'll tell you that this
means that the machine will act sensibly if you are holding down one key and
then press another without releasing the first.  This will be useful to fast
touch typers.

The Second Rob Hubbard Music Routine

  In this article, the second Rob Hubbard music routine will be presented in
the same way as the first. Future issues will hopefully examine various other
music routines including various Martin Galway, Benn Daglish, Jeoren Tel,
and Manaics of Noise routines. Note: Unfortunately the author completes
university (and thus loses internet access) in August 1993.

DYCP - Horizontal Scrolling

DYCP - is a name for a horizontal scroller, where characters go smoothly
up and down during their voyage from right to left. One possibility is a
scroll with only 8 characters - one character per sprite, but a real demo
coder won't be satisfied with that.

Multi-Tasking on the C=128 - Part 2

This article will examine the actual code that makes up the multi-tasking
kernal in detail and include some example programs explaining it use.

The 1351 Mouse Demystified

This article will explain how the 1351 mouse works as well as provide an easy
to use interface in machine language for both basic and machine language
programmers.
