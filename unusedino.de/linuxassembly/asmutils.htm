<h3>Release notes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
Asmutils no longer come with precompiled binaries. Instead,
a Linux distribution based on asmutils called <b>a-Linux</b> is available.
It is a single-floppy mini-distribution, you can download it
<a href="http://unusedino.de/linuxassembly/asmutils/a-linux-0.17.tar.gz">here</a>.
It is in the early stage of development, and eventually will become
a completely individual project.
<b>At the point, current version of a-Linux is still based
on previous version of asmutils (0.17)</b>.

<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
<blockquote>

<p align=justify>
 asmutils is a set of miscellaneous utilities written in assembly language,
 targeted on embedded systems and small distributions (e.g. installation
 or rescue disks); also it contains a small libc and a crypto library.
 It features the smallest possible size and memory requirements,
 the fastest speed, and offers fairly good functionality.
 Now project supports Linux and BSD family (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD);
 Unixware, Solaris, and AtheOS support is in beta stage (also there's
 no more supported BeOS port), and it is /theoretically/ possible to
 port it to any i386 OS. 
<p align=justify>
 Another goal of this package is to provide a *portable* framework,
 and to encourage assembly programmers to write for Linux/UNIX.
 Usually UNIX is associated with C, and no one wants to deal with assembly..
 Browse the source, look -- it is simple. Read the docs, start to write,
 and you will like it; assembly programming is a lot of fun, especially
 when you deal with a UNIX-like operating systems.
<p align=justify>
 In addition, this package has some "special bonus" like small intros,
 games, and other various assembly snippets.
<p align=justify>
 These utilities also may be useful for system administrators;
 there were several reports that they have rescued when libc
 crashed and it was not possible to use usual system utilities.
<p align=justify>
 Hey, we are a light in the darkness of bloatware. Do you see?

<h3>Does anyone use asmutils?</h3>
<blockquote><p>
I was told that following distributions use asmutils:
<p><ul>
<li><a href=http://smalllinux.netpedia.net>Small Linux</a> uses quite a lot of them
<li><a href=http://www.turbolinux.com>Turbo Linux</a> includes asmutils as .rpm
<li><a href=http://www.prosa.it/etlinux/>Etlinux</a> uses a couple of them
<li><a href=http://www.stampede.org>Stampede GNU/Linux</a> includes asmutils as .slp
